in 9@@ 11 Call , Professor Ad@@ mits to Shooting girl@@ friend
in a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor Sh@@ ann@@ on lamb told police he had shot his girl@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lamb made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found A@@ my Pren@@ tis@@ s &apos; body and a hand @-@ written note s@@ cri@@ b@@ bled on a white legal p@@ ad : &quot; I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in C@@ level@@ and , Mis@@ sis@@ sip@@ pi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school &apos;s campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well @-@ liked history professor , E@@ than Sch@@ midt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.@@ m.
he said lamb made the fat@@ eful 9@@ 11 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated lamb .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in G@@ au@@ tier , where Pren@@ tis@@ s died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Sch@@ midt himself had included lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations of problems .
a student who praised lamb , Brand@@ on Be@@ av@@ ers , said he also seemed ag@@ itated and j@@ it@@ tery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year .
lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s hiring policies meant that the doc@@ torate lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William La@@ F@@ orge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between lamb and Sch@@ midt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. lamb &apos;s mind . &quot;
those are questions lamb can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up lamb &apos;s trail when he crossed back into Mis@@ sis@@ sip@@ pi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be apprehended , lamb killed himself with a single .@@ 38 @-@ cal@@ i@@ ber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mis@@ sis@@ sip@@ pi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ thel Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of lamb &apos;s longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the hear@@ t@@ thro@@ b back then .
all the girls would mel@@ t when he was around , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pren@@ tis@@ s had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 9@@ 11 call , lamb said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever marrying .
they had a dog named L@@ ightning that lived with them at the br@@ ick house that backs up to a b@@ ay@@ ou in G@@ au@@ tier .
police said the dog was OK .
Pren@@ tis@@ s &apos; ex @-@ husband , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; she was completely devastated , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met lamb but heard through his daughter A@@ big@@ ail that lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Pren@@ tis@@ s when he and A@@ big@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gi@@ g .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment co@@ ordinator at The Jul@@ ep R@@ oom , a dim@@ ly lit bar near G@@ au@@ tier , said he last saw lamb and Pren@@ tis@@ s the night of S@@ ept . 5 , after lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
there was no sign of anything am@@ iss .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one @-@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of w@@ it about them .
Sch@@ midt , the slain professor , directed the first @-@ year seminar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kan@@ sas and was president of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and student government .
on the Delta State campus in C@@ level@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ l@@ elight memorial .
Sch@@ midt &apos;s wife , Liz , and brother Jef@@ f Sch@@ midt also attended the vig@@ il , during which the university choir sang &quot; bright Morning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace . &quot;
classes resume Wednesday .
&quot; we &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &quot; La@@ F@@ orge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Solis reported from C@@ level@@ and , Mis@@ sis@@ sip@@ pi .
associated Press writers Emil@@ y W@@ ag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Mis@@ sis@@ sip@@ pi , and Re@@ bec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Or@@ le@@ ans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying lamb made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Sch@@ midt , and that while lamb referred to Pren@@ tis@@ s as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

UN Chief Says There Is No Military Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U@@ .@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U@@ .@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U@@ .S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ sol@@ v@@ able . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Poll Num@@ bers That Show Donald Trum@@ p Is For Real
some have tried to label him a f@@ lip @-@ Fl@@ op@@ per .
others have dismissed him as a jo@@ ke .
and some are holding out for an impl@@ os@@ ion .
but no matter how some Republ@@ icans are trying to drag Donald Trum@@ p down from atop the polls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trum@@ p &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Trum@@ p is likely to win the Republican nomination .
p@@ und@@ its point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recogn@@ izing Trum@@ p &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
tr@@ ump &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Trum@@ p announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republ@@ icans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Republ@@ icans have a favorable view of Donald Trum@@ p .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ i@@ ac poll in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 percent of Republ@@ icans there had a favorable view of Trum@@ p .
two @-@ thirds of G@@ OP voters would be happy with Trum@@ p as the nominee .
in a CNN / O@@ RC poll last week , 67 percent of Republ@@ icans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Trum@@ p were the nominee .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he were the nominee .
only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trum@@ p ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trum@@ p ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the f@@ lip side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nominee .
a majority of Republ@@ icans don &apos;t see Trum@@ p &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Trum@@ p has been widely criticized for his bomb@@ ast and insults , 52 percent of lean@@ ed Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temper@@ ament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s ABC News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation caucus state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 percent of Republ@@ icans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ i@@ ac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independents say his temper@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their p@@ und@@ it hats , Republican voters think Trum@@ p is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ OP nomination , four in 10 said Trum@@ p was the best bet , according to a CNN / O@@ RC poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
full disclosure : G@@ OP voters haven &apos;t had the cle@@ arest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republ@@ icans picked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
still , it shows that a plurality of G@@ OP voters see Trum@@ p &apos;s campaign as plausible .
even if Republ@@ icans rallied around another candidate , Trum@@ p still beats almost everyone .
some p@@ und@@ its point out that the spl@@ inte@@ red field is likely contributing to Trum@@ p &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ Trum@@ p support is be spread diff@@ us@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head match@@ up between Trum@@ p and most other Republican candidates , Trum@@ p almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Ru@@ bio by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ AN@@ D Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a bare majority of Donald Trum@@ p &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trum@@ p say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
still , Trum@@ p &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ sider neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trum@@ p .
six in 10 Republ@@ icans say they agree with Trum@@ p on immigration .
even since Donald Trum@@ p called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that Trum@@ p &apos;s bomb@@ ast will drive crucial His@@ panic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republ@@ icans say they agree with Trum@@ p on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Trum@@ p will remain too .
frustration with government is climbing to new high@@ s .
Donald Trum@@ p and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their out@@ sider status .
six in 10 Republ@@ icans in Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll say they want a political out@@ sider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines Regis@@ ter / Bloomberg poll in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Republ@@ icans are frustrated with Republ@@ icans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Qu@@ es@@ tions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ enly awaited
new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Qu@@ es@@ tions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could sk@@ ip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respectful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , Ow@@ en Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent Rob@@ in Br@@ ant says policy differences are also &quot; st@@ acking up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 2@@ 6,000 to £ 23,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the des@@ pat@@ ch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Isl@@ ington North MP has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both &quot; repar@@ tee &quot; and trading bar@@ bs , instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business secretary , will de@@ pu@@ tise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Comm@@ ons Speaker John Ber@@ c@@ ow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; pun@@ ch and Jud@@ y &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key barometer of a leader &apos;s judg@@ ement , their command of the Comm@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caric@@ ature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

p@@ ound rises as UK wage growth accel@@ erates
the p@@ ound jumped following data showing a pick @-@ up in UK wage growth , while the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9 % compared with the same period last year .
the rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
ster@@ ling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 5@@ 05 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .

Met@@ cash launches grassroots campaign to fight Al@@ di incursion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its IG@@ A stores from an Al@@ di onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia .
grocery wholes@@ al@@ er Met@@ cash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
as Al@@ di prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IG@@ A brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the A@@ del@@ aide show .
IG@@ A retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough @-@ based ice cream maker Sim@@ mo &apos;s offering taste testing at IG@@ A stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liquor and hard@@ ware wholes@@ al@@ er hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A store foot@@ print and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notori@@ ously par@@ och@@ ial and IG@@ A retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Victoria and Qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in wa compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
in a report this week , Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in wa next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Met@@ cash &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Ro@@ y Morgan survey found IG@@ A shoppers were most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes Met@@ cash &apos;s food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016 , 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash could &quot; highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos; comments .
but it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash &apos;s food and grocery business , which supplies about 1@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating del@@ ever@@ age as sales and margins come under pressure .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ er is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shelf prices at Col@@ es and W@@ ool@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping IG@@ A retailers refurb@@ ish stores by adding faster @-@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label gro@@ cer@@ ies .
Met@@ cash chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store refurb@@ ishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholes@@ al@@ er will return to underlying profit growth in 2017 , for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly

Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves k@@ ud@@ os rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the &quot; Special K@@ S , &quot; was dragged into an un@@ welcome spotlight by the infamous Kyr@@ gi@@ os sl@@ edge of St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fiery qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison twice had to be separated by the chair um@@ p@@ ire , with Har@@ rison declaring : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka should &apos;ve dec@@ ked Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should deck that k@@ id . &quot;
while he was last seen sm@@ ashing a r@@ acqu@@ et after cr@@ amp fo@@ iled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been defended staunchly by He@@ aly .
the teenager is currently in Gl@@ as@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Gro@@ th for the second singles ber@@ th behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing I do feel quite ke@@ enly about is I think Than@@ asi &apos;s been dragged into the fr@@ ay a little bit , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he did break a r@@ acqu@@ et when he lost when he cr@@ amped in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a r@@ acqu@@ et out of frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know he wouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
he &apos;s a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he hasn &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the loc@@ ker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also backed the decision to overlook Kyr@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Friday , describing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long @-@ term fi@@ xture in the team .
&quot; first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary declares emergency , seals border , det@@ ains migrants
declaring a state of emergency , Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in .
chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants p@@ iled up in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries &apos; checkpoints , those fleeing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pit@@ ched tents and settled in .
but frustrations were on the rise .
as a police helicopter hovered above , migrants chanted &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
the turmoil at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors .
Tuesday &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sz@@ ij@@ j@@ ar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a razor @-@ wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspondent Char@@ lie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison inmates were en@@ listed in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bottlen@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4 @-@ meter ( 13 @-@ foot ) razor @-@ wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis , &quot; government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kovac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , homeland security adviser to Orban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offen@@ ses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly repairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them .
chaos envel@@ op@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to sque@@ eze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Bern@@ ie Sand@@ ers cut by half in national poll
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Sen@@ . Bern@@ ie Sand@@ ers is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while Sand@@ ers comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary contests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month &apos;s C@@ BS News Poll , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while Sand@@ ers has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have narrowed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and Sand@@ ers only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evapor@@ ated , and she and Sand@@ ers are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sand@@ ers by double @-@ dig@@ its among liberals , but Sand@@ ers now has a 5 @-@ point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nominee .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusias@@ tically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner , Donald Trum@@ p ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open @-@ ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement on the issues , and elec@@ t@@ ability are also cited .
as the vice president weighs a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nomination , Biden is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sand@@ ers .
if Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Sand@@ ers wid@@ ens , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fifty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ t@@ ability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
majorities see Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Biden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don &apos;t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many as say that about Sand@@ ers ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Biden as in line with their views ide@@ ologically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sand@@ ers .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn &apos;t impacted their overall views of her .
but it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Republ@@ icans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
sixty @-@ two percent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and trustworthy .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don &apos;t see Trum@@ p as honest and trustworthy either .
both Clinton and Trum@@ p , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Biden , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on honesty .
more see Sand@@ ers as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald Trum@@ p in national poll
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Trum@@ p in the newest C@@ BS News / New York Times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ un@@ ging for a footh@@ old
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trum@@ p in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last C@@ BS poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
but Car@@ son roc@@ keted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , edging out Trum@@ p among college @-@ educated Republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio G@@ ov@@ . John Kas@@ ich , has slipped behind with Wis@@ cons@@ in G@@ ov@@ . Scot@@ t Walker falling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former Florida G@@ ov@@ . Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ kan@@ sas G@@ ov@@ . Mike H@@ uck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ . Marco Ru@@ bio all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of error for the 3@@ 76 @-@ person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus @-@ or @-@ minus 6 % , and was conducted S@@ ept .
the latest CNN / O@@ RC survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republ@@ icans , behind Trum@@ p &apos;s 32 % support .
the latest poll from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trum@@ p significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
facing a rising Car@@ son last week , Trum@@ p took some pot@@ shots at the retired neuro@@ surgeon , even as Car@@ son apolog@@ ized for questioning Trum@@ p &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Trum@@ p said last Saturday during a campaign stop in I@@ ow@@ a .
five fr@@ at@@ ernity members charged in death of Bar@@ uch College fres@@ h@@ man
nearly two years after a college student died during a fr@@ at@@ ernity haz@@ ing ritual in Pen@@ n@@ sylv@@ ania &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i Delta PSI fr@@ at@@ ernity brutally assaulted ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation r@@ ite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was bl@@ ind@@ fol@@ ded , sadd@@ led with a 30 @-@ p@@ ound backpack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually complained that his head hurt then fell un@@ conscious .
P@@ i Delta PSI fr@@ at@@ ernity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Den@@ g passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Den@@ g &apos;s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference .
&quot; at this point , members began to hide par@@ aph@@ ern@@ alia and basically put the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s well @-@ being over that of Michael Den@@ g &apos;s , &quot; Chief W@@ ag@@ ner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning .
according to an au@@ top@@ sy report , Den@@ g was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head , tor@@ so , and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families have been devastated as a result of fr@@ at@@ ernity haz@@ ing , with at least one student dying every year from haz@@ ing since 1970 , &quot; Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , an attorney representing Den@@ g &apos;s family , said in a statement .
Fr@@ at@@ ern@@ ities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended third @-@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two other fr@@ at@@ ernity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with assault haz@@ ing and criminal conspiracy .
&quot; we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organization that sanctioned it , whether officially or unofficially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College banned the fr@@ at@@ ernity and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter .
here &apos;s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hike will come and the bul@@ l market will stum@@ ble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
this we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ siveness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that &apos;s why officials at the U@@ .S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to norm@@ alize .
there are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate @-@ hike f@@ uss may have been over@@ done .
&quot; the first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U@@ .S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
that &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; it does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12 @-@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bob dol@@ l , chief equity strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ v@@ een As@@ set Management , posted on Barr@@ on &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate @-@ hi@@ king cycle and returns begin to diminish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hast@@ en a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; Deutsche said .
market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and economists believe the FO@@ MC could approve a hike at this meeting , fu@@ tures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study since 1950 , all hi@@ king cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing pre@@ recession peaks very quickly post the recovery comm@@ encing , &quot; the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equ@@ ities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hi@@ king cycle bond yields fall immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b strateg@@ ists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between long@@ er@@ - and shorter @-@ dated bonds to move closer together , flatten@@ ing the cur@@ ve .
high @-@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cautious about stretching for yield , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analyst at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates are up , the yield cur@@ ve is flat@@ ter , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
broadly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U@@ .S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
&quot; history shows that &apos; quality &apos; stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , &quot; Gold@@ man S@@ achs analysts said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance sheets outpac@@ ed weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic F@@ M says MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
conservative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham criticised station for &apos; dum@@ bing down@@ &apos;
argues it &apos;s becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ ishable from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Br@@ its
colleague Dam@@ i@@ en Coll@@ ins MP attacked The Voice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; Classic F@@ M , a leading MP has claimed , piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not .
conservative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; dum@@ bing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ ishable from its commercial rival .
&quot; Radio 3 seems to be - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ bing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into Classic F@@ M , &quot; he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just mim@@ ic@@ king what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; and also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commis@@ sion@@ ing new works I think is also really important , &quot; he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 control@@ ler Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less educated about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s output which came under fire for t@@ reading on the to@@ es of commercial rivals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ i@@ en Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BB@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and boy George as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wants the Corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in @-@ house stable &quot; next time it launches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future , or spending licence fee pay@@ ers &apos; money on other entertainment form@@ ats .
internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe November &apos;s Black Friday could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain &apos;s high streets into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
&apos;@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to rationalise over time , &apos; Andy Mul@@ ca@@ hy , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Guardian .
he explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different cont@@ ex@@ ts , such as on the SOFA .
but now that is plat@@ e@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals cr@@ ashing a number of retailers websites .
experts believe Black Friday , which saw shoppers fight over bargains , could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
research published by the British Ret@@ ail Consortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in mec@@ ca cran@@ e crash as B@@ in Laden family sanctioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in mec@@ ca
come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Bin@@ lad@@ in Group
the Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 94 people were also injured after the cran@@ e crashed down
carried al@@ oft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a cran@@ e collapsed at mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand mosque .
dressed largely in white , mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ se@@ m cemetery .
the sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction cran@@ e crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worship@@ ers .
the bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the B@@ in Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the worship@@ ers killed when a cran@@ e crashed collapsed at mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
among the dead was father @-@ of @-@ four Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram , from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , who was on his first pilgrimage when the cran@@ e crashed down .
Mr Ak@@ ram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual haj@@ j pilgrimage .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the haj@@ j to mec@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to desc@@ end on the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group should not have left the cran@@ e &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
an Arabic version of the decree , carried by the state @-@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
earlier this week Sal@@ man vowed to reveal what caused the cran@@ e to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conv@@ erg@@ ed ahead of the haj@@ j pilgrimage later this month .
Bin@@ lad@@ in Group has not released any statements about the cran@@ e collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the royal decree also blamed the group for not using up @-@ to @-@ date safety measures and failing to co@@ ordinate with meteorological officials .
dozens of cranes surround mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand Mosque , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group .
the Bin@@ lad@@ in family has been close to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .

B &amp; Q boss says Eastern European trad@@ es@@ men working cheap is behind trend
Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men says Ver@@ on@@ ique La@@ ury
number of skilled trad@@ es@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
resulting in 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at trad@@ es@@ men , opening
at same time King@@ fish@@ er is closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets across the country
by Ru@@ per@@ t Steiner , Chief City Cor@@ respondent for the Daily Mail
Brit@@ ons are said to be putting down their ham@@ mers and pain@@ t@@ br@@ ushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European trad@@ es@@ men to carry out work in their home
if you are hand@@ y with a hammer or a wh@@ iz@@ z at painting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q@@ .
Ver@@ on@@ ique La@@ ury , new chief executive of King@@ fish@@ er , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled trad@@ es@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock @-@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , King@@ fish@@ er is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at trad@@ es@@ men , while closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said she wants more women to be employed in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said : &quot; we still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision @-@ making process .
M@@ rs La@@ ury , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain &apos;s F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
King@@ fish@@ er is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
King@@ fish@@ er posted a fall in both half @-@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of shutting stores .
as a result of the trend King@@ fish@@ er , which owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is opening 200 new stores
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
the world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ b@@ ide , senior fellow at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding tril@@ lions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
however the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Mis@@ sis@@ sip@@ pi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Sh@@ ann@@ on lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wished he &quot; could take it back , &quot; authorities revealed Tuesday .
police in G@@ au@@ tier , Mis@@ s. said lamb , a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a.@@ m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
lamb told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house that is &quot; not going to bother anyone &quot; but is likely upset .
police asked the call@@ er his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from lamb , 45 , that said : &quot; I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only person who ever loved me .
after writing the note , lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed E@@ than Sch@@ midt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as c@@ ops closed in .
University President William La@@ F@@ orge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between lamb and Sch@@ midt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. lamb &apos;s mind . &quot;
despite reports Monday that lamb allegedly believed Pren@@ tis@@ s was also roman@@ tically involved with Sch@@ midt , authorities said Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; love triangle . &quot;
Pren@@ tis@@ s was described as a &quot; good person &quot; by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pren@@ tis@@ s had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; devastated . &quot;
he said Pren@@ tis@@ s and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pren@@ tis@@ s worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , identified as a close friend of Pren@@ tis@@ s by the Sun Herald .
K@@ now@@ les said Pren@@ tis@@ s , who had a h@@ ound dog named L@@ ightning , had been dating lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; K@@ now@@ les said .
police said lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
when c@@ ops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , lamb pulled his car over , b@@ ailed out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
lamb received a doc@@ torate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university &apos;s website .
stars who lost their m@@ oj@@ o
the actor ( left ) , pictured with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , has had a st@@ res@@ s@@ ful few years .
in 2001 , he battled leukemia , and in 2009 , he lost long @-@ time partner , Far@@ ra@@ h F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , to cancer .
the actor has also reportedly struggled with drugs , and in 2008 , he was busted for drug possession .
all that stuff sure does take a toll .
Manchester United &apos;s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w out for months with double frac@@ ture
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United &apos;s Champions League defeat at P@@ SV E@@ ind@@ h@@ oven .
while this left the full @-@ back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al remains hopeful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reckless tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mo@@ reno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had burst into the P@@ SV area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fant@@ as@@ tically and then this happens .
when it was in the d@@ ressing room he had an oxygen mask on .
he was crying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double frac@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mo@@ reno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot @-@ kick .
Nic@@ ola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the referee , did not penalise the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had erred .
you can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two leg@@ s .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : &quot; thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how gu@@ tted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffer Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w blow in defeat at P@@ SV
the England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the P@@ SV coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Mo@@ reno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mo@@ reno &#93; touched it , but I couldn &apos;t see the tackle on Lu@@ ke .
speaking to S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 , Mo@@ reno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
P@@ SV &apos;s Andr@@ és Guard@@ ado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better than this ?
it &apos;s one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cameron .
asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids &apos; book , the prime minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the Super@@ C@@ amps company , continuing : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
all very well , except that the subsequent parag@@ rap@@ h in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pr@@ é@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to p@@ ad out the fairly brief original text .
&quot; set in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Aud@@ rey , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; it reads , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ uss , real name Theodor Se@@ uss Ge@@ is@@ el , who died in 1991 .
if that wasn &apos;t suspicious enough , Cameron &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ ax film provided on the Internet Movie database website , which begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Aud@@ rey . &quot;
given he is an av@@ ow@@ edly hands @-@ on parent , it seems unlikely Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young unnamed boy he@@ ars how the local environment was devastated by the av@@ ar@@ icious , tree @-@ ch@@ opping , th@@ need @-@ kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ onymous Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at , mou@@ st@@ achi@@ o@@ ed cre@@ ature who &quot; speaks for the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been out@@ sour@@ ced to an aide , seemingly one who has never read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
a Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron &apos;s constituency office .
Super@@ C@@ amps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron &apos;s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England omission but it &apos;s still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 T@@ est series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I wouldn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
Ala@@ st@@ air C@@ ook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that bat@@ ting lineup and the collective mindset is strong ; they will not carry scars from 2012 , only a youthful positi@@ vity .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and Adil Rash@@ id , even if he is an unknown quantity at T@@ est level , represents an attacking option .
related : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England T@@ est squad and replaced by Alex Hal@@ es
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
his seven T@@ ests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters are judged on output .
there were no question marks over Joe R@@ oot , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
a couple of half @-@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
hopefully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire another opportunity will come along .
the England head coach , T@@ rev@@ or Bay@@ lis@@ s , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a T@@ est bat@@ sman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven cap@@ s - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jonathan T@@ rot@@ t in the Car@@ ibbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a bat@@ sman I rate highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire saw early this season when he made 2@@ 36 against us on a T@@ rent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make @-@ up of the side in the UAE .
the idea of Mo@@ een opening the bat@@ ting alongside C@@ ook , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four qu@@ ic@@ ks , has been floated and it is not something I am against .
I don &apos;t see why a stro@@ k@@ em@@ aker cannot b@@ at there and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown he is one hell of a cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ c@@ est@@ er@@ sh@@ ire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team @-@ Mate Justin L@@ anger played his first 38 T@@ ests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Zaf@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squad as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and , in my limited dealings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw stat@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the b@@ at and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of spin@@ ners putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d additions to their coaching staff .
the appointment of Ma@@ hel@@ a J@@ ay@@ a@@ war@@ den@@ e , the Sr@@ i L@@ anka bat@@ sman , as a consultant for the T@@ est matches could be a master@@ stroke .
he is one of the game &apos;s lov@@ eli@@ est bl@@ okes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the white @-@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless stre@@ ak into the setup .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cr@@ ic@@ ket , be it playing or coaching , and like Ma@@ hel@@ a has n@@ ous that can be tapped .
sometimes new voices in the d@@ ressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fres@@ hen up a side .
Col@@ ly &apos;s Dur@@ ham team @-@ Mate Ben st@@ okes is rested for the one @-@ day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the coaches and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken lightly .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp might win the day if economy is in d@@ old@@ ru@@ ms by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s half @-@ baked re@@ negotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the TU@@ C cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages too .
a European diplomat ch@@ um explained the other day that , sunk in ass@@ or@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain &apos;s self @-@ absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don &apos;t want .
in B@@ righ@@ ton for its annual bean , the TU@@ C decided it didn &apos;t want them either if they eroded social protection .
we could even call it Dave and George &apos;s sel@@ fi@@ e agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European PAL , who wants an outw@@ ard @-@ looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - suggests that more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany &apos;s cautiously level @-@ headed chancellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ r@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran@@ ç@@ ois Holl@@ and@@ e is facing re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is a f@@ ading force too .
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ fi@@ e Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , SNP @-@ style , during the UK &apos;s 2017 referendum campaign to hast@@ en the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my PAL suggests .
&quot; the re@@ negotiation was a fix &quot; and &quot; Britain got nothing of value out of the re@@ negotiation . &quot;
the Europeans know to their cost how pre@@ d@@ atory Fle@@ et Street can be and how EU @-@ scep@@ tic the olig@@ arch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may dim@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the arch Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist , making his name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 9@@ 0s .
for all his fool@@ ishness E@@ d Miliband knew who his enemies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ shy r@@ asc@@ als , phone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and p@@ se@@ ud@@ o non @-@ dom@@ s who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a c@@ age with a Rand@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the ban@@ anas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact Miliband was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cameron &apos;s referendum whe@@ eze , since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU &apos;s abor@@ ted constitution , sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get @-@ out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at West@@ min@@ ster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re @-@ adopting Ne@@ il K@@ inn@@ ock &apos;s boycott Mur@@ doc@@ h strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC SOFA he vacated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kind@@ ly call evolving .
he says he &apos;d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ k@@ ip &apos;s w@@ o@@ ad @-@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der shores of T@@ ory little En@@ gl@@ ander@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy Sc@@ out in him struggled not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of ab@@ r@@ as@@ ive John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old d@@ ad struggled on TV to be dis@@ loyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was saying , nor what J@@ C told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom @-@ up , tou@@ chy @-@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ strom that is social media , a hotbed of par@@ an@@ o@@ ia and betrayal .
it &apos;s fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell has said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equiv@@ oc@@ ation about EU membership - consistent with their Ben@@ n@@ ite siege economy , anti @-@ capit@@ alist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic discussion among lef@@ tw@@ ing dissidents for whom the nar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central Ten@@ et of doctr@@ inal squab@@ bles .
as with his equiv@@ oc@@ ation over Na@@ to - Tom Watson is adamant that J@@ C won &apos;t campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the Br@@ its &quot; fe@@ e@@ ble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts criticise Public Health England e @-@ cigarettes review
claims by a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) joined the L@@ anc@@ et in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; landmark &quot; report last month , describing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but several researchers have questioned the ro@@ bust@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the L@@ anc@@ et medical journal last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily fl@@ im@@ sy foundation &quot; on which PH@@ E based its main conclusion .
writing in the B@@ M@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ gi@@ ene and Tro@@ pical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epid@@ emi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public would expect PH@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ C@@ DA ) model to syn@@ thes@@ ise their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study .
he also endorsed BAT &apos;s public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e @-@ cigarette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PH@@ E .
the research paper produced by the group &quot; tell@@ ingly concedes &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said PH@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and wellbeing at PH@@ E , said the claims in the B@@ M@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
one in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e @-@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
PH@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking @-@ related illness and smoking costs the NH@@ S £ 2@@ b@@ n a year .
by sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e @-@ cigarettes are not risk @-@ free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national rem@@ it .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says former Channel 4 chief
the former Channel 4 chairman Lu@@ ke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders and The Voice , saying its commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters .
he criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals &quot; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC &apos;s director general , Tony Hall , said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie @-@ up with the BBC without success .
&quot; I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsidised rivals , &quot; Johnson told the House of L@@ ords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
if you keep the licence fee , which I &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren &apos;t making and commis@@ sion@@ ing .
they broadcast The Voice in a prime s@@ lot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s l@@ ud@@ ic@@ ro@@ us , it &apos;s obviously nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a regres@@ sive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy .
the Voice is one , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly made in @-@ house .
fran@@ kly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think that would diminish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ asing ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the BBC &apos;s most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ T@@ ag@@ gart lecture in E@@ din@@ burgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said the BBC &apos;s more niche public service programmes &quot; go on to BB@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfil their rem@@ it and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious missions about justifying £ 4@@ b@@ n in licence fee income , &quot; W@@ ell of course , we do all these obsc@@ ure programmes that no one watched . &quot;
they put them on a s@@ lot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the licence fee , Johnson told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more regres@@ sive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don &apos;t consume a lot of the BBC .
former Sky and Channel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should revise its Re@@ ith@@ ian mission to &quot; inform , educate and entertain . &quot;
he said little of the BBC &apos;s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and entertain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a handful were shown on TV , and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change direction the moment they are blasted with s@@ onic pul@@ ses .
scientists have b@@ red wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change direction the moment they are blasted with s@@ onic pul@@ ses that are too high @-@ pit@@ ched for humans to hear .
the pul@@ ses work by switching on motor ne@@ ur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry memb@@ ran@@ e channels that respond to ul@@ tr@@ asonic waves .
related : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said the wor@@ ms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed s@@ on@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , in which ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and mus@@ cle cells from outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , a researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep @-@ brain stimul@@ ation , an inv@@ as@@ ive procedure that delivers electrical pul@@ ses into people &apos;s br@@ ains to treat symptoms of Par@@ k@@ inson &apos;s disease .
Nem@@ at@@ ode wor@@ ms do not usually react to ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a flu@@ id containing micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found , ampl@@ ify the ul@@ tr@@ asonic waves which then pass inside the wor@@ ms .
the amplified ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 Ion channels , found in the memb@@ ran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms &quot; cells .
the sound waves make these Ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
to make ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their motor ne@@ ur@@ ons carried TR@@ P @-@ 4 Ion channels .
when he applied ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound to the modified cre@@ atures , the sound waves were amplified by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they switched on the modified motor ne@@ ur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch ne@@ ur@@ ons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that s@@ on@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over that technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fib@@ re to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hindered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that , using gen@@ e therapy and a therap@@ eu@@ tic virus , it may be possible to make target human ne@@ ur@@ ons temporarily susceptible to the ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on mus@@ cle cells and ins@@ ul@@ in @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student halls
it &apos;s been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an obl@@ i@@ vi@@ ous 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still believing in Berets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but it &apos;s only now I recall the strained smiles of those I anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be dis@@ til@@ led into eight simple rules .
moving into halls can range from mil@@ dly nerve @-@ rac@@ king to totally terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you &apos;re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly neither love nor hate Mar@@ m@@ ite because seriously guys it &apos;s just ye@@ ast extract HA@@ HA@@ H@@ A I &apos;ll be in my room . &quot;
take a breath .
and help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
it ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you to Sc@@ out out the people you like versus those you wouldn &apos;t talk to even if your ey@@ el@@ ashes were on fire and they were dis@@ pen@@ sing extingu@@ ishers .
give people space .
people &apos;s rooms often mor@@ ph into drinks rec@@ eptions , movie @-@ night venues and communal hang@@ out spots , but they &apos;re also where people get dressed and adjust their under@@ wear .

In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
your room should be a retreat , yet many halls form an inter @-@ room @-@ st@@ rolling culture that &apos;s friendly , social and conducive to lifelong friendships .
that can be hell for someone who &apos;s trying to re@@ charge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I &apos;ve exp@@ ended on inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alising - and maybe text instead of knocking .
speaking of knocking : do it .
one guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn &apos;t locked he was invited in .
he saw some things .
make friends through baking .
since you &apos;re starting Un@@ i at the height of bake @-@ O@@ ff mania , knocking on people &apos;s doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brow@@ n@@ ies seems margin@@ ally less we@@ ird , less 1950s &quot; Wel@@ come to the neighbourhood , I baked you something , now smile as I ask you personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends .
your h@@ ous@@ em@@ ates will feel obliged to chat , and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise .
obviously this is subject to you being a decent b@@ aker .
poorly @-@ f@@ used l@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be as@@ leep when you knock .
stealing food is a common crime in student halls .
obviously nic@@ king some@@ ones chicken is theft , but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing ?
double check with the milk owner .
chances are they &apos;ll tell you to help yourself even if they &apos;re se@@ eth@@ ing inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hall@@ mate , who tainted her milk with washing @-@ up liquid to punish those who stole it .
she &apos;s in jail now .
you shouldn &apos;t make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
this isn &apos;t just to be a decent human , but because you are the prov@@ erb@@ ial people in glass houses .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn &apos;t mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3@@ am and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded by turning it up .
when they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kind@@ ly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music , locking her door as she left for her three @-@ hour exam .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse happened to move into the same hall as you ?

of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hall@@ mate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .
in the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment you realise someone &apos;s left their keys inside their un@@ locked room , the line between pr@@ an@@ king and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .

oil companies officially collapsed
an investment of 400 billion dollars was shelved and most deep @-@ sea oil exploration projects were suspended between 2014 , when oil prices started to drop , and the end of last year .
according to research from the consulting company Wood Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie , low oil prices were the cause of the suspension of the 380 billion dollar @-@ project for oil and gas exploration / production , and the production of millions of barrels of oil was postponed in a vast area reaching from the Mexican Gulf to Africa .
the report showing that the biggest reason for the price drop is that oil prices have fallen from their 2014 level of 115 dollars to their lowest level in the last 12 years , losing more than 70 percent of their value in 1.5 years , includes the statement that &quot; company budgets have dramatically shrunk . &quot;
400 billion dollars ON hold
while the crude oil price continues to surprise every single day , it has recently fallen under the 30 dollar mark , which is its lowest level in the last 12 years .
in these days of heated debates about &quot; whether the price of oil can fall below 15 dollars , &quot; or &quot; whether oil is dirt cheap , &quot; the research published by the energy consulting firm Wood Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie reveals how the sector has been affected by the falling prices .
suggesting that the falling oil prices caused the suspension of 46 big energy investments worth 200 billion dollars in a report published in July , Wood Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie , in new research , disclosed what the total figure was up to the end of 2015 .
according to this , while 22 more projects were postponed in the last six months of 2015 , a total of 68 projects were suspended from 2014 , when the drop in oil prices began .
the value of these projects is estimated at around 400 billion dollars .
2.9 million barrels PE@@ R day
in the research , it has been underlined that the low oil prices had a &quot; brutal &quot; effect on company plans and it has been noted that the projects most affected were deep water development projects .
the suspended projects correspond to a total reserve of 27 billion barrels of crude oil , and the daily production of 2.9 million barrels has therefore been delayed until 2025 .
according to the research , the final investment decision for most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned projects was later shelved until 2017 , and the first production goals are targeting the years between 2020 and 20@@ 23 .
the report underlines that the postponed 68 projects include a potential 170 billion dollar investment that is predicted to be carried out in the next 5 years , and &quot; most of the 170 billion dollars is comprised of deep water projects . &quot;
the reason for this is the high preliminary investment costs .
it is said that &quot; 70 percent of the deep @-@ sea expenditure is made up in particular of oil based projects in Nigeria , Ang@@ ola and the Mexican Gulf in the U@@ .S. &quot;
according to the research , the countries having the biggest number of suspended projects are Canada , Ang@@ ola , Kazakhstan , Nigeria , Norway and the U@@ .S.
these six countries have almost 90 percent of the suspended liquid ( oil ) reserves .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Australia , Malaysia and Indonesia account for the biggest number of suspended gas reserves with 85 percent of the total .
most of the natural gas waiting to be extracted lies in deep waters , and requires complex and expensive solutions such as building a liqu@@ efied natural gas ( LNG ) plant from scratch .
it has been stated that the most endangered companies are the oil giants having successive under@@ tak@@ ings in the Canadian oil S@@ ands and the Caspian Sea Region , and it is said that these companies are trying to adapt to the scenario of &quot; lower for longer &quot; oil prices .
eyes ON Iran
just four years ago the situation was as follows : the U@@ .S. and Europe imposed an embargo on Iran oil to stop Tehran &apos;s nuclear program ; the barrel price of oil was around 110 dollars and debate centred on how Iran &apos;s oil exports would be cut without causing any sharp jump in the prices .
when we return to this week , we witness a very different scenario .
oil prices have fallen below 30 dollars for the first time since 2004 , and the principal cause of this was the production boom in the U@@ .S. ; and embar@@ goes imposed on Iran being abolished .
for this reason , all the eyes are on Iran .
if Iran increases its oil exports , more oil will be added to the market , which is said to be already quite full .
this may cause the price to fall below even the surprising levels of today .
some analysts are saying that Saudi Arabia , not wanting to lose any market share to Iran , will pump more oil and Iran and S. Arabia will enter a price war .
soon after the elimination of the enfor@@ cements , it is stated that the principal targets of Iran are India , being the fastest growing oil market in Asia , and its old partners in Europe .
Iranian officials have previously said that they aimed to increase initial exports by 500 thousand barrels a day and to add the same amount to the market after a while .
according to the map data from Reuters , there are 22 very large crude carriers ( V@@ L@@ CC ) waiting off the coast of Iran , 13 of which are fully or mostly loaded .
Iran is in the position of being the country with the fourth biggest proven oil reserves in the world .
thanks to exceptions within the embargo , Iran currently exports approximately 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries including Turkey .
before the embargo , Iran &apos;s daily oil export increased to 3 million barrels a day .
a research specialist at securities company Dest@@ ek Men@@ k@@ ul De@@ ğ@@ er@@ ler , Ay@@ sun G@@ ö@@ ks@@ u , answers the question of whether oil will fall below 20 dollars as follows : &quot; China @-@ centred global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices and intensi@@ fies the drop in oil prices . &quot;
we are seeing that losses reached 20 percent since the beginning of the year amid concerns that the demand for oil would decline in line with the economic slowdown in China , which is the biggest oil importer in the world .
in addition to this , we may witness oil prices below 30 dollars in the forthcoming days due to the effects of the global appreciation of the dollar and the problem of global excess supply .
as long as we do not see any permanent pricing above the 32 @-@ 33 dollar @-@ level , the upward movement of oil prices may remain limited and the downward pressure on prices may increase .
at that point , we can say that closing prices under the 30 dollar @-@ level will play a key role in the continuation of the decline .
in this situation , it should be no surprise if it is seen that there is a loos@@ ening of the support level of 23.@@ 30 @-@ 25.@@ 60 in the lower end .
Is@@ ham Sar@@ dou@@ k : &quot; the era of ang@@ els is now over ! &quot;
while carrying out the duty of trend creation in W@@ G@@ S@@ N , which determines the fashion trends of Victoria &apos;s Secret and the world ; why did you change your course to Turkey ?
- I am always pro @-@ change .
I was born in Paris , lived in London , and after that went to New York .
I took up key positions there .
meanwhile , I started to provide consultancy services to Kot@@ on over the last two years .
after that I saw the potential in this area and the brand Kot@@ on .
I re@@ alized that everything needed to be a worldwide chain store was there .
now I &apos;m here to make it happen .
can you achieve this in a short time ?
- sure .
even though it is a small brand , it is already sold in 50 countries .
we launch 50 collections every year , we have 15 different sections .
in other words , there is everything a chain store needs to have .
we can respond to the needs of the consumers in different areas from Dubai to Moscow .
currently , we are opening a store in Paris in May , and it is the beginning of a new and exciting era ...
is it a must to open a store in Paris ?
- Yes .
it is not because the economic situation in Europe is great .
however , you open some stores for image .
you have stores in fashion capitals such as Paris , London and you make money in the Middle East .
one of them adds prestige to the brand and the other adds money ; both of them are necessary for a brand making an effort to be global .
OK , so let &apos;s talk about the trends ...
- We have a romantic and ch@@ ic season ahead of us .
flying chi@@ ff@@ on d@@ resses , smooth ton@@ es , pin@@ ks , wh@@ ites , reds .
designs ...
we are experiencing harsh and brutal times ; the fashion world always brings ch@@ ic and heart @-@ warming designs to the podium and tries to add a tiny bit of happiness to life in times like this .
what we are doing is the same .
for this reason , the &quot; era of eleg@@ ance &quot; is returning in the new season .
let &apos;s go back to your years in Victoria &apos;s Secret .
who was the most legendary ang@@ el ? - Kar@@ olina Kur@@ kova .
I am not talking about her g@@ org@@ eous physi@@ que : she is so positive and she is such a good girl !
while working , she sat beside me and said &quot; Are you hungry , honey ? &quot; and gave me an apple , etc .
in a word , she was so sweet .
you also know what I am talking about , I looked into you and discovered that you have done lots of interviews with all the models of Victoria &apos;s Secret .
Kar@@ olina is so beautiful , isn &apos;t she ?
but Adri@@ ana Lim@@ a also impressed me with her beauty ...
- You have a point , but that voice !
her voice , her in@@ ton@@ ation ...
it stresses you after a while and you say , &quot; sit somewhere and look beautiful ; do nothing else ! &quot;
it can irrit@@ ate .
yes , you can experience these kinds of shocks .
I done an interview with Cand@@ ice Sw@@ an@@ ep@@ o@@ el .
she was the most beautiful girl I &apos;ve ever seen in my life but I was aston@@ ished by her empty @-@ head@@ edness .
- Most of them are like that .
the new ang@@ els are not like in the past ...
I remember the time of G@@ is@@ ele ...
it was quite hard to work with her though .
she used to come back@@ stage and smoke like a ch@@ im@@ ney .
it was not because she is add@@ icted .
nobody can smoke you see , only she can smoke !
it is just to be a &quot; div@@ a . &quot;
broadcast two months ago , the Victoria &apos;s Secret fashion parade got the lowest rating in its history .
why do you think that is ?
- As I said , that legendary era of beautiful ang@@ els is now over .
pardon me , who needs G@@ igi Had@@ id ?
what is beautiful about her ?
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , for example , she is as flat as a board ...
there are no cur@@ ves , there is nothing .
K@@ ate mos@@ s is not cur@@ vy either but she became the biggest name in the fashion industry .
- It is true but her face was so beautiful .
I want to use my right to object .
last year , I did an interview with her ; her face has gotten quite old ...
- Between smoking and alcohol , she naturally lost her beauty .
but she had such a beautiful face in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
her li@@ ps were like Brig@@ itte Bar@@ do@@ t &apos;s .
she represents the end of the super@@ model era .
the era of Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a , Na@@ om@@ i C@@ amp@@ bell and Chris@@ ty Tur@@ l@@ ington ...
Chris@@ ty was my next door @-@ neighbour and I saw her without makeup .
there cannot be such pure beauty , there cannot be such eleg@@ ance .
what about C@@ ara Del@@ ev@@ ing@@ ne ?
- S@@ he &apos;s w@@ asting herself .
there is no need to be involved in every campaign .
people get bo@@ red .
besides , there is no hunger for &quot; famous models and celebrities &quot; like in the past .
people want to see real faces like their own faces in the campaigns .
we will go towards this .
because the trend is this .
a letter to Turkey from 25 authors
according to reports from BBC Turkish , writers from the Worldwide Association of Writers ( PE@@ N ) , including its presidents in England , Wal@@ es and Scotland , stated that threats and physical attacks against their colleagues , writers and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life .
in the letter , the investigations and detention of journalists in Turkey were regarded as worrying developments as well as the two attacks on the Hurriyet daily newspaper , the raid on the Koz@@ a Group and detention of Vice News correspondents .
part @-@ time work rights for mothers causes debate
Tür@@ k @-@ İ@@ ş says &quot; We think that part @-@ time rights have been given to mothers to bring in labour for hire . &quot;
&quot; it may be a Tro@@ jan horse , &quot; and T@@ İ@@ SK claimed &quot; We are worried about whether this regulation on behalf of women will prevent women from work or not . &quot;
new rights planned for civil servants and working women after giving birth or adoption were passed by the committee after day long negotiations .
&quot; labour for hire &quot; became the main topic in the committee negotiations of the regulations , which will bring the right of part @-@ time work or unpaid leave to 6 months after giving birth and part @-@ time work up until primary school age for the child .
while stating that it is proper to recruit on a part @-@ time basis until the child starts primary school they still have worries , a CHP deputy of Izmir Musa Ç@@ am added , &quot; If you bring the labour for hire regulation , we will stand against it to the bitter end . &quot;
taking part in the ne@@ go@@ tions on behalf of Tür@@ k @-@ İ@@ ş and saying they have the same worries , En@@ is Ba@@ ğ@@ d@@ ad@@ io@@ ğlu stated , &quot; We have doubts about how the places for part @-@ time working women will be filled . &quot;
adding that if labour for hire is added to the agenda again on this occasion there will be matters much more problematic than sub @-@ contracted labour , Ba@@ ğ@@ d@@ ad@@ io@@ ğlu said , &quot; We will watch the developments related to private employment agencies with much concern . &quot;
the general secretary of T@@ İ@@ SK , B@@ ü@@ lent Pir@@ ler stated that part @-@ time work for a period of 5 years came about with this law , and he added , &quot; There is no part @-@ time work for such a long period in other countries . &quot;
also look at the matter this way .
&quot; it is necessary to think about the consequences of this implementation in places having 1 or 2 employees . &quot;
TO@@ BB advisor Ahmet Ş@@ a@@ ğ@@ ar also said that there will be problems finding workers if the regulation is implemented .
adding that there is no legislation related to the rules to be implemented on part @-@ time work , Ş@@ a@@ ğ@@ ar stated , &quot; Employers and employees should come to an agreement until regulations related to private employment agencies have been made . &quot;
Metin F@@ ey@@ z@@ io@@ ğlu : we don &apos;t support it
the statement from F@@ ey@@ z@@ io@@ ğlu is as follows : &quot; we don &apos;t stand by this declaration ; it is not possible for us to stand by and support it . &quot;
because there isn &apos;t one sentence of criticism against the PKK .
you couldn &apos;t say anything unfavourable , even one sentence against this separatist terror organization , the PKK ; they are considered above blame .
they are only harsh expressions to the state ; we don &apos;t take those who used them seriously or find them sincere .
we are legal experts , we are lawyers .

they will be deported with bic@@ y@@ cles
however , the refugees , most of whom are Syrians , will have to return to Russia by ped@@ alling in minus 20 degrees because the two countries could not reach an agreement .
a group of refugees went to Russia by plane , travelled to the north of the country and went to Norway from Mur@@ man@@ sk because it is safer and cheaper during the summer months .
as the agreement between the two countries does not allow crossing of the border on foot , the refugees crossed the border by bicycle .
Norway has now decided to return these refugees .
for this reason , the Norway Police ordered the repair of the bic@@ y@@ cles that were abandoned after crossing the border .
&quot; 3 billion euros to Turkey &quot; crisis in EU
the crisis is continuing with 3 billion euros pledged to Turkey for the refugees .
the President of the European Commission , Jean Claude Juncker , criticised the Prime Minister of Italy , Mat@@ te@@ o Ren@@ zi &apos;s blocking of the funds to be transferred to Turkey .
stating that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good , Juncker underlined that the EU has to find the 3 billion euros .
Juncker said &quot; This money is not for Turkey , but for Syrian refugees in Turkey . &quot;
we have not yet reached 3 billion .
&quot; this is an issue related to the credibility of the EU and is therefore very important , &quot; he said .
Juncker stated that he expected the money to be completed by January 26 , which was the deadline given .
Italy is one of the countries drawing attention for their positive attitudes when it comes to Turkey .
diplomatic sources say that Rome &apos;s stance is related to the financial package and not towards Turkey , and is related to the problems between Italy , the European Commission and some member countries of the union .
there has been tension between Italy and the EU for a while now .
Ren@@ zi continued to harshly critici@@ ze the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , and the EU in the latest EU summit on energy , banking and immigration .
critici@@ zing the attitude of Ren@@ zi in yesterday &apos;s press conference , Juncker said that &quot; Ren@@ zi should quit accusing the EU . &quot;
&quot; it is wrong of Ren@@ zi , even though I like him very much , to humili@@ ate the European Commission on every occasion . &quot;
Juncker implied that Ren@@ zi plays to internal public opinion .
1 billion of the 3 billion euros , promised to Turkey , will be covered by the EU budget .
2 billion euros will be covered by the budgets of the member countries .
Germany will contribute at l@@ est 4@@ 27 million euros .
it has been decided that 2.3 billion euros will be transferred to the EU budget and used to support Jordan and Lebanon by the Greek Cypriot Administration , which declared that it won &apos;t transfer money to Turkey for political reasons .
the funds are predicted to be used during the 2016 @-@ 2017 period .
I cried when I saw the Char@@ lie Heb@@ do cartoon
speaking to the Russian official news agency S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik , the father Abdullah Kur@@ di reacted strongly and said , &quot; to tell the truth , I cried because of that cartoon . &quot;
&quot; I felt very bad . &quot;
stating that he expected positive things from the French sati@@ rical magazine Char@@ lie Heb@@ do , which has become the symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack , Kur@@ di added the following :
they made a bad cartoon unfortunately .
everybody felt very sad about this cartoon .
A@@ yl@@ an is a 2 year old boy and he died .
Char@@ lie Heb@@ do was supposed to show respect to A@@ yl@@ an , to me and my family , but the exact opposite is true .
this magazine should show respect to the dead children .
they published a dis@@ respectful cartoon about our honourable Prop@@ het .
they even made publications regarding Allah .
compared with the publications on Allah and our Prop@@ het , what they done to my son is a small thing .
Kur@@ di , living in Er@@ b@@ il , made the following appeal : &quot; I call on the whole world and the sati@@ rical magazines to show respect to all the dead children . &quot;
they should not add to the grief the families are already suffering .
Tim@@ a Kur@@ di , an aun@@ t of A@@ yl@@ an Kur@@ di living in Canada , is also among those to react to the cartoon .
in the cartoon by Lau@@ rent &quot; Ris@@ s &quot; S@@ our@@ is@@ se@@ au , it is implied that 3 year old Syrian A@@ yl@@ an Kur@@ di , whose dead body came ashore at Bodrum , &quot; may have become one of the sex abusers in Germany when he grows up . &quot;
last year , having been exposed to an attack in which religious radicals killed 12 people because of the publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad , French sati@@ rical magazine Char@@ lie Heb@@ do become the focus of discussions with its cartoon of A@@ yl@@ an Kur@@ di .
in the cartoon the mol@@ est@@ ers , with pig heads , ev@@ oking immigrants and also ch@@ asing women , who were portrayed like the women abused during the new year celebrations in Germany , especially Cologne .
having stirred up different reactions on social media , the cartoon is part of a column consisting of 4 frames .
&quot; this is not France &quot; is written on the column , and the lost values of France and increasing hostility against refugees are criticized according to many readers .
on the other hand , the cartoon caused many people to accuse Char@@ lie Heb@@ do of racism .
while Char@@ lie Heb@@ do praised Germany , which accepted 800 thousand refugees , it criticized France for its unwilling attitude towards opening its doors to refugees in an issue published last year .
it was said in the cartoon &quot; the goal was too close &quot; and &quot; two children &apos;s men@@ us for the price of one &quot; was written in the advertising poster .
&quot; Aut@@ op@@ sies in Germany for the Germans who died in Sul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met &quot;
according to information on the website of the weekly magazine Der Spiegel , the German Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office decided that the bodies of the 10 people who died in the attack , will be brought to Germany .
the bodies of the dead will be brought home today or tomorrow on a German Air Forces plane and will be welcomed by a ceremony at the airport .
experts from the I@@ denti@@ fication Commission of the Federal Criminal Police Office ( B@@ KA ) , who carry out forensic operations in Germany , normally travel to the countries where an incident has occurred to conduct the identification and au@@ top@@ sy for German citizens killed in accidents or attacks .
however , the magazine Der Spiegel wrote that things will be done differently this time .
according to the magazine , officials from the Federal Criminal Police Office applied to Turkish authorities to conduct the identification and au@@ top@@ sy operations in Istanbul but the request was refused .
the Federal Criminal Police Office sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack .
treatment is continuing on seven German tourists who were injured in the attack .

banning of male refugees from swimming pools
in a report in the German press , it was reported that the ban will be lifted if the volunteer workers from the dormit@@ ories notify them that the message has been understood by the refugees .
stating in his interview to W@@ D@@ R that the municipality does not want to punish innocent people because of the behaviour of a few people , an official from the social affairs department , Markus Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ ka , said that those staying in the dormit@@ ories had been informed in three languages about the important values in Germany .
noting that they will not discuss the value of gender equality important to Germany , Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ ka added that the municipality will punish all kinds of attacks and harassment .
meanwhile , R@@ he@@ in@@ berg has cancelled its annual carnival because of the possibility of Cologne @-@ style attacks occurring during the celebrations .
the municipality declared that the festival parade was cancelled because there is no guarantee that incidents of harassment would not occur .
what are the benefits of steam cooking ?
a technique that does not kill vit@@ am@@ ins and minerals in food , steam cooking is becoming increasingly popular .
steam cooking , one of the most preferred cooking methods in the Far @-@ East for centuries , strengthens the met@@ abol@@ ism and makes dig@@ estion easier .
bacteria and ger@@ ms in food are completely erad@@ icated with this method , which also elimin@@ ates problems such as dy@@ spe@@ p@@ sia .
substances found in foods such as prote@@ in , cell@@ ul@@ ose and star@@ ch completely dis@@ ol@@ ve using this technique , making the food sof@@ ter .
taking place in low pressure , steam cooking is done in a cooking pot with the help of steam pot@@ s or steam machines .
both the amount of water used and the cooking time is less when cooking at high pressure .
the best example of this is cooking in a pressure coo@@ ker .
especially for cooking di@@ etary foods such as vegetables , it is necessary to wash the vegetables well first , and then it is necessary to put them into a str@@ ain@@ er and wait for the water to strain .
one @-@ third of a deep cooking pot is filled with water and a steam str@@ ain@@ er is placed inside the pot .
the mouth of the cooking pot is half closed .
in this way , we allow steam to escape from the cooking pot .
firstly the heat of the oven is set to the highest degree and the water is boiled ; after the temperature is fixed by setting the heat in the oven to a lower degree .
the vegetables and food are steam cooked for 10 @-@ 15 minutes and are then checked with the help of a for@@ k once they are cooked .
the cooked vegetables are removed from the oven and served on plates .
appearance , colour and ar@@ oma of the food do not change with the steam cooking technique ; therefore this is a healthy method .
the distinctive taste of the food stays the same .
therefore the quality and flavour of the food are not spoiled .
loss of nutrition is kept to a minimum in steam cooking , which is also the most economical way of cooking .
Ste@@ amed vegetables offer a satisfactory flavour for the din@@ er with their fresh and vibrant appearance .
frequently used , especially as part of a diet , this method is often preferred also because it is very light .
David B@@ ow@@ ie - Black@@ star : the ali@@ en &apos;s &quot; last album &quot;
knowing that you will die ; producing that final album without telling anyone ; making your de@@ ath@@ bed an artistic expression in the music video you shot ...
these kinds of actions may seem &quot; extreme &quot; to us mor@@ tal earth@@ lings .
I say mor@@ tal earth@@ lings because I am among those who believe that the man who did this is both Im@@ mor@@ tal and ali@@ en .
he came to our world from some corner of the universe ; now he has returned to his motherland ; which is just how it goes .
he came because it was necessary to inspire not only Kis@@ s , Mar@@ il@@ yn Man@@ son or Lady Gag@@ a , but also all the singers of the world .
he fulfilled his duty with success .
David B@@ ow@@ ie , Black@@ star , i@@ Tun@@ es price : 9.@@ 99 TL 5 / 5
maybe he was nour@@ ished by War@@ h@@ ol and Ku@@ br@@ ick from the same planet as him .
when A@@ pol@@ lo 11 landed on earth , he decided to say &quot; this is nothing , I am an ali@@ en , &quot; and he joined us by singing &quot; Space O@@ d@@ d@@ ity . &quot;
actually he did not join us ; he was always ahead of us .
thanks to him , many people found their way .
both musicians and listen@@ ers ...
if we leave aside his interest in plastic arts , his acting etc . , it would be wrong to say that his music was &quot; just music . &quot;
the characters he created by himself , travelling from song to song , his references , innovation , taboo @-@ breaking behaviour and disco@@ graphy reflect an artistic integrity for me .
I can remember him neither as the father of g@@ lam rock , nor as the cousin of punk ...
if I remember him like that , what will happen to his avant @-@ garde and electronic works , and to jazz , which he kept as an internal love since his childhood ?
David B@@ ow@@ ie always reminded us what the expression &quot; icon &quot; means , up until that time when the word spread like wild@@ fire .
he was not a man ; he was not a woman ; he was not &quot; human . &quot;
he was a body .
it seemed to us that he was on a mission .
that body left this world two days after the release of his 26th studio album &quot; Black@@ star . &quot;
he tried to prepare us for the fact that he would leave with &quot; Black@@ star &quot; and &quot; Lazar@@ us , &quot; which we had listened to before the release of the album .
we thought that &quot; he has gotten old now , so he talks about death , &quot; but he was aware of everything .
one more final hand ...
we can say that there are four songs that we already knew when the album was released ; &quot; Black@@ star &quot; and &quot; Lazar@@ us , &quot; shou@@ ld@@ ering the burden of message and emotion , &quot; S@@ ue ( O@@ r In A Season O@@ f Crime ) &quot; and &quot; T@@ is A p@@ ity S@@ he W@@ as A Wh@@ ore , &quot; previously released but re @-@ recorded for this album .
I would add that the remaining songs , &quot; Girl Lov@@ es Me , &quot; &quot; I Can &apos;t G@@ ive Every@@ thing A@@ way &quot; and &quot; D@@ oll@@ ar Days , &quot; are also very good .
when we look at &quot; Black@@ star &quot; as a whole , it was created on a very strong musical structure , but it feels like it was produced with sincere and in@@ stan@@ tane@@ ous feelings as well .
it is an album neither of death nor a &quot; reck@@ oning with the past ... &quot;
it is just a real &quot; final &quot; album .
&quot; the End &quot; cap@@ tion of a life in music , which is a masterpiece in its entirety .

a price increase of 25 k@@ ur@@ u@@ ş on bread in Ankara and Istanbul
with an increase of 25 k@@ ur@@ u@@ ş , 25@@ 0@@ g of bread began to be sold for 1 TL as of yesterday in Ankara .
upon speculation that &quot; the price of bread would increase &quot; before the new year , especially in December , Faruk Ç@@ el@@ ik , minister of food , agriculture and livestock , and B@@ ü@@ lent T@@ ü@@ fe@@ k@@ çi , minister of customs and trade stated that &quot; there would be no price increase . &quot;
however , 25@@ 0@@ g of bread was selling for 1 TL yesterday in the capital , Ankara .
the head of the Turkish Bak@@ ers &apos; Federation , Halil İ@@ bra@@ him Bal@@ c@@ ı stated that , regarding the 25 k@@ ur@@ u@@ ş price increase on bread , &quot; No price increase was imposed , the price list of 2 years ago began to be applied &quot; and added :
&quot; it was a price decision taken 2 years ago . &quot;
the Chamber of merchants &apos; union decided on this price 2 years ago .
it is a price implemented throughout Turkey .
in other words , there was no application and implementation of a price increase .
however some bakeries sold bread for 75 k@@ ur@@ u@@ ş in some regions of Ankara due to competition .
in other regions , it was already being sold for 1 TL .
bak@@ ers , confident about the quality of their bread , did not decrease their prices . they have to implement 1 TL due to competition .
there is no price increase .
they are implementing the price that had not been implemented before .
&quot; the price of bread per kilo certainly won &apos;t exceed 5 TL in the first half of 2016 , and we will end this year with this price if we do not experience any major problems . &quot;
in some areas of Istanbul , bread started to be sold for 1.@@ 25 TL .

we used the expression &quot; standing firm . &quot;
I@@ sil have stopped using Wh@@ at@@ s@@ ap@@ p , and now use the Al@@ ra@@ w@@ i application
according to a new report , the terrorist organization I@@ sil is benefiting from its own chat tool for commun@@ icating without having to depend on applications such as Wh@@ at@@ s@@ ap@@ p and telegr@@ am .
according to the report from Defense One , the organization is benefiting from a new mes@@ saging application for mes@@ saging inside the organization .
named &quot; Al@@ ra@@ w@@ i , &quot; this An@@ dro@@ id application is distributed and installed via an A@@ P@@ K file .
the application allows the organization to ci@@ ph@@ er messages and share media among themselves .
a surprising move from I@@ sil in Iraq
according to gh@@ ost Security Group , functionality of the application is &quot; prim@@ itive &quot; in comparison with such popular applications as Wh@@ at@@ s@@ ap@@ p and telegr@@ am .
for now , it is not known how strong the ci@@ ph@@ ering used is .
before this , I@@ sil carried out all of its communication via telegr@@ am , an application allowing messages to be sent on enc@@ ry@@ p@@ ted connections .
however , telegr@@ am revealed all the channels in which the I@@ sil members were chat@@ ting .
in addition to this , the U@@ .S. government has requested that application developers put back @-@ doors in their applications .
for this reason , the organization has now started to use its own solutions rather than relying on the ci@@ ph@@ ering of Wh@@ at@@ s@@ ap@@ p and telegr@@ am .

in his Twitter message to the Iranian people , President of Iran , H@@ ass@@ an Rou@@ h@@ ani declared that he congrat@@ ulates the removal of sanctions after the nuclear agreement between six countries and Tehran .

how to use the mid @-@ term break ?
how should students use the mid @-@ term break ? - we asked this question to educational specialist and student coach , Murat Ay@@ d@@ ın .
students should not only think of mid @-@ term break as spending time rest@@ ing , enter@@ taining and watching television .
mid @-@ term break is an important opportunity to get ready for the new school term and to review last term .
being free time , the mid @-@ term break is also a good opportunity for personality development , acquisition of knowledge and skills , and taking up a new h@@ ob@@ by .
make a list of what to do during the term .
write down everything you plan to do , and try to put it into practice .
you can be sure that you will benefit from this and have a more efficient term .
now , firstly , let &apos;s talk about how efficient the term should be for students preparing for the Y@@ G@@ S @-@ L@@ Y@@ S exams .
because the most common questions coming from the students preparing for Y@@ G@@ S @-@ L@@ Y@@ S are as follows : &quot; how should we use this time , should we solve a lot of questions or finish incomplete subjects ? &quot;
firstly , lets introduce our article with both the answers to these questions and some advice to those who are preparing for the exam in order to spend the time efficiently .
while the preparation period for the exams should be a process that starts from the 9th grade , under normal conditions , we are trying instead to complete it in the final 1 year ; this obliges us to spend our last year more effectively , by using our time more efficiently and properly .
a final grade student must deal with both the exam preparation and preparation for school written exams at the same time .
even if the graduate students have finished school and experienced the exam ( Y@@ G@@ S @-@ L@@ Y@@ S ) at least once , the year they prepare for the exam again as a graduate student is critically important for them as well .
because most graduate students and their families see &quot; that &quot; year as a last chance , which creates greater stress .
revision is the study that students do not like ; they do it because they feel obliged to do it ; and therefore they always postpone it to the last moment ; but it becomes completely a duty for the students that do it regularly and make it a habit ; and there is always a plan for what and when things need to be done .
now we have a mid @-@ term break ahead of us and we have to use it in the best way possible .
to do this , we should always have a plan that allows us to manage our time well .
studying for L@@ ess@@ ons during mid @-@ term break :
firstly , everyone should make a plan suitable to their situation .
1 . they should include what they have covered , what are the incomplete subjects in their plan and they should plan their days , weeks and 15 @-@ day periods .
there should be both lesson revision and question solving in this period .
in the meantime , students that do not have any incomplete subjects can solve 1 or 2 mock exams on average .
deal with Your In@@ complete subjects : Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week , 66 percent in a day , and 54 percent in an hour .
the best and most effective method of eliminating this tendency to forget is by doing revision .
especially students who make too many errors in prior lessons should concentrate on studying with general revision .
firstly , determine what are the incomplete subjects and make your plan everyday ; choose one lesson everyday and completely deal with it .
this planning will help you in both academic and psychological situations .
when adding subjects to your plan , pay attention to the subjects you make the most errors in .
because there will be no long holiday periods in the future .
solve Qu@@ es@@ tions :
question solving is as important as revising lessons .
because we can see how much we understand the subjects we study only through the feedback from the questions we solve .
do not forget to select a number of questions to be solved each day .
the number of questions you solve may change in line with what you study ; you may not solve many questions on a day that you mostly study lessons , but we should still solve questions to a certain extent , at least in order to see how much we learned from the lesson of that day .
solve M@@ ock exams :
another area of study to look into during mid @-@ term break should be solving mock exams .
even if all the subjects are not finished , you can solve mock exams at least for each lesson .
Sup@@ posing that you finished a Turkish lesson , you can solve a 40 @-@ question mock exam of Turkish .
you should definitely keep track of time while doing this .
if you solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes , your next target should be to complete it several minutes faster .
vacation and h@@ ob@@ by Plans :
of course , a break does not only mean studying for lessons , you should spare a few days for vacation , to rest and spend time on your h@@ ob@@ b@@ ies .
a holiday period spent only studying for lessons will stop you from having fun and relaxing .
for this reason , there should be special time set aside for yourself .
reading books , watching television or sur@@ fing the internet may be in your plans , but the most important thing is how much time you spare for each activity .
I have some advice for those who say that I could not spend the first term efficiently .
if you can say that I could not spend the first term well , I could not study much and I missed many lessons , this mid @-@ term break is a big opportunity for you as well .
nevertheless , you should firstly decide on and believe this .
most of the goals in the 2009 @-@ 2010 Turkish Super League were scored between minutes 76 and 90 .
now , answer the question you ask ; do you go to the loc@@ ker room after the end of the match or is the match still continuing and is there enough time for you to score a goal ?
I sup@@ pose that no one wants to say , &quot; we will look forward to our next match , &quot; a conventional expression used by the coach or players of a losing football team .
now , the only thing you should do is look forward and let go of the past , and run instead of walking .
to summar@@ ize what we said :
1 ) Fir@@ stly make a mid @-@ term break plan ,
2 ) revise the lessons you know ,
3 ) F@@ inis@@ h any incomplete subjects ,
4 ) consolidate what you have learned by solving questions ,
5 ) Sol@@ ve mock exams ,
6 ) Re@@ ad books ,
7 ) determine new goals for next term ,
8 ) S@@ par@@ e time for you , your h@@ ob@@ b@@ ies and the things you enjoy ,
9 ) S@@ par@@ e time for your family and your friends ,
10 ) S@@ par@@ e time for social and cultural activities ( cinema , sport , theatre , concert , travel , pic@@ n@@ ics , etc . )
&quot; Ker@@ van &quot; took to the road
the founder of Ker@@ van , one of the biggest &quot; home &quot; chain stores in Turkey with 45 stores of 100@@ 0 square meters on average , Ş@@ in@@ asi Dem@@ i@@ rel and his son Hasan have now incorporated Home S@@ we@@ et Home , which has 17 stores abroad and 25 stores here in Turkey .
with the recent completion of trade registry procedures , Ker@@ van is now the owner of 17 Home S@@ we@@ et Home stores abroad .
stating that there are still no Ker@@ van stores abroad , Ş@@ in@@ asi Dem@@ i@@ rel said , &quot; From now on , we will continue with big ret@@ ailing with Ker@@ van and smaller ret@@ ailing with Home S@@ we@@ et Home . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ van will also expand abroad . &quot;
a retail chain and producer with a turnover of 140 million Turkish L@@ ira was created with the merger of Home S@@ we@@ et Home , with a 50 million Turkish L@@ ira turnover , and Ker@@ van , with a 90 million Turkish L@@ ira turnover in 2015 .
Ker@@ van &apos;s total retail area , with 45 stores in 35 provinces , is 45 thousand square metres .
25 of the stores belong to the parent company .
there are around 500 people employed by Ker@@ van .
home S@@ we@@ et Home has 25 stores in Turkey and 17 stores abroad , its total retail area is 6@@ 500 square metres , and its number of employees is around 320 .
carrying out production , export and ret@@ ailing with his partner Ale@@ v Pak@@ ten , Home S@@ we@@ et Home &apos;s Chairman , Kadir Kal@@ ay@@ c@@ ı@@ o@@ ğlu stated that they are very happy with the merger with Ker@@ van and added , &quot; We are from Mar@@ din and entered this sector in 1998 . &quot;
from the very beginning , we created a brand with the support of Mr. Ş@@ in@@ asi .
Mr. Ş@@ in@@ asi is like the &quot; TRT &quot; of this sector .
we learned a lot from him as well .
moreover , we took our first steps in retail when he gave us his store in Ak@@ mer@@ ke@@ z .
in fact , we were working with Ker@@ van as a strateg@@ ical partner , not a rival .
&quot; from now on , a very important synergy will emerge with this merger . &quot;
Kal@@ ay@@ c@@ ı@@ o@@ ğlu explained that there are 17 Home S@@ we@@ et Home stores abroad , most of which are in the Middle East ; and they started exports to China last month .
Kal@@ ay@@ c@@ ı@@ o@@ ğlu said , &quot; We opened our first corner in Shanghai . &quot;
we agreed with a chain store which has 200 stores .
&quot; from now on , we will develop big ret@@ ailing as Ker@@ van and small ret@@ ailing with Home S@@ we@@ et Home abroad . &quot;
Por@@ os@@ h@@ enko sells his factory in Russia
giving an interview to the news site L@@ ig@@ a@@ .net about the matter , the CEO of Ros@@ hen , V@@ yach@@ es@@ lav Mos@@ kal@@ ev@@ sky , said that the factory was put up for sale for 200 million dollars .
Mos@@ kal@@ ev@@ sky confirmed , &quot; Yes , we put the factory on sale . &quot;
adding , &quot; as soon as we put it on sale , all the real buyers suddenly disappeared , &quot; and indicated that there is no buyer in view .
regarding the price of the firm in Li@@ pe@@ t@@ sk , a town in Russia , Mos@@ kal@@ ev@@ sky said , &quot; We determined it as approximately 200 million dollars . &quot;
producing 450 thousand tonnes of chocolate and conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery every year , Ros@@ hen is one of the biggest producers and belongs to Ukraine President Petr@@ o Por@@ o@@ chenko .
Yı@@ ld@@ ı@@ z Holding becomes Pl@@ adis abroad
Yı@@ ld@@ ı@@ z Holding combined all the acquired global companies , active in the bis@@ cuit and chocolate sectors , under the name &quot; Pl@@ adis . &quot;
with the merger combining the brands De M@@ et &apos;s , Go@@ div@@ a , United bis@@ cu@@ its and Ü@@ l@@ ker , a new food giant worth 5.2 billion dollars was born , in which 26 thousand employees work .
speaking at a meeting related to the merger of the global companies within Yı@@ ld@@ ı@@ z Holding , Murat Ü@@ l@@ ker , Yı@@ ld@@ ı@@ z Holding &apos;s Chairman , said , &quot; To be a global company was our target from the beginning &quot; and added :
Murat Ü@@ l@@ ker broadcast the 3@@ 35 million Turkish lira sale live on Per@@ is@@ cope
founded 72 years ago , this company is now proceeding under the name &quot; Yı@@ ld@@ ı@@ z Holding &quot; and becoming a global brand , a global company around the world in the business of bis@@ cu@@ its , chocolate and conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery .
in this period , we have advanced in various branches of the industry from ret@@ ailing to packaging , from real estate to personal care in addition to bis@@ cu@@ its , chocolate and conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery .

stating that all of Yı@@ ld@@ ı@@ z Holding has created a &quot; family of more than 50 thousand people , &quot; Ü@@ l@@ ker said , &quot; Now , when we look at the possibilities of our family , we want to go back and focus on bis@@ cu@@ its , chocolate and conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery , namely our main business ; we are getting re@@ organized for this , &quot; and he talked about the new structuring as follows :
life story of the father of Ü@@ l@@ ker , Mr. Sabri
we are now re @-@ evaluating our company structure and getting re@@ organized .
we have divided the world into regions .
and we distributed these regions to our CE@@ Os .
Mehmet , Mohammed and Jef@@ f will be our regional CE@@ Os .
Mehmet T@@ ü@@ t@@ ü@@ n@@ c@@ ü is responsible for Turkey , the Middle East , North Africa and Turk@@ ic Republ@@ ics .
Mohamed El@@ sar@@ ky is responsible for the continent of America and Japan , in addition to our Go@@ div@@ a business .
Jef@@ f van der E@@ ems will be responsible for the United Kingdom , Contin@@ ental Europe and Africa .
while Ali Ü@@ l@@ ker , who I can say is a quality and innovation gur@@ u , under@@ takes a global responsibility in his area , Cem Karak@@ a@@ ş will help me in the administration of the job .
China , Russia and part of South @-@ East Asia will be the regions we will establish and develop .
Murat Ü@@ l@@ ker sold a share in SAF Real Estate Investment Trust
he continued , &quot; We are promising happiness to the whole world in every bite , &quot; Murat Ü@@ l@@ ker said , &quot; The name of our global firm is Pl@@ adis , which we established to make this promise real . &quot;
he said , &quot; If you ask from where the name Pl@@ adis comes , actually the name has no special meaning &quot; and added :
Az@@ tec@@ s called it May@@ a .
Japanese people , Su@@ bar@@ u , Per@@ vin in Iran .
S@@ ü@@ re@@ y@@ ya in Arabic ; we gained inspiration from the name of the star cluster , P@@ le@@ iades , which is made up of seven stars and means Ü@@ l@@ ker in Latin .
and so , we translated Ü@@ l@@ ker globally .
Vice Chairman of the Board of Yı@@ ld@@ ı@@ z Holding , Ali Ü@@ l@@ ker , underlined that they &quot; started to create a synergy in innovation &quot; by collaborating with laboratories in different countries , and added :
we have very valuable R &amp; D teams ; we gained certain syn@@ ergies so far from the work on the R &amp; D platform by gathering these teams together .
we have 27 R &amp; D centres under Pl@@ adis .
the biggest ones are in the United Kingdom and Turkey .
more than 300 R &amp; D specialists are working here .
synergy projects have already started to produce results .
produced by Ü@@ l@@ ker with export to United Kingdom due to start , Dig@@ esti@@ ve b@@ alls ( N@@ ib@@ bles ) are produced in the chocolate factory of Ü@@ l@@ ker in Sil@@ iv@@ ri .
another example of synergy : Ü@@ l@@ ker Kris@@ pi T@@ ı@@ r@@ t@@ ı@@ kl@@ ı , which are the same products but with different brands .
by adapting crack@@ er technology developed in the United Kingdom , namely the product Jac@@ ob &apos;s Cr@@ in@@ kl@@ ys , into Turkey in a short time , we brought the pleasant taste to Turkey under the name Ü@@ l@@ ker Kris@@ pi T@@ ı@@ r@@ t@@ ı@@ kl@@ ı .
very well known by everyone , La@@ vi@@ va was introduced to consumers in the U@@ .S. today .
call of Du@@ ty series exceeds the 250 million mark
with their names being written in gold letters in the games world , the series of games by Ac@@ ti@@ vision , In@@ fin@@ ity Ward , Tre@@ y@@ arch and Sledgehammer Games seem not to be forgotten for many years .
the newly announced sales figures especially prove how much we should find this series legendary .
Ac@@ ti@@ vision , who hold the lic@@ encing rights of the series , showed that 250 million copies were sold in the end of tear special sales issue .
sharing the sales figures for all the series at the beginning of last year , the company succeeded in selling 75 million copies of the game Call of Du@@ ty from that time to now .
if we say that the main part of this issue is made up of Black O@@ ps 3 , we won &apos;t be much mistaken .
Kemal K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu was elected as General President again
Kemal K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu was elected as the general president again in the regular congress .
receiving the votes of 9@@ 90 delegates out of 12@@ 38 , K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu became general president again .
2@@ 48 of the votes cast were declared null and void .
party members cheered after the results were announced .
CHP had 12@@ 75 delegates in total .
the congress finished its endeavours and gathered at 10 : 00@@ am on Sunday .
in the congress , K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu stated the following in his summary :
we would have liked people to dance and sing folk songs here .
however , where we stand now is under@@ whel@@ ming .
the reality is that Turkey could not be governed .
the resulting atmosphere over@@ shad@@ ows all of that .
the cause of the pessimism is those who are governing the country .
as a member of CHP , we are against terror no matter where it comes from .
terror is a crime against humanity and the terrorists should not be for@@ given .
the fight against terrorism is carried out with intelligence , knowledge and compreh@@ ension .
we certainly want to fight against it , and we want everybody to be untouched .
what is the difference between the photographs from the Southeast and the photographs from Syria and Lebanon ?
when they came to the table , they made serious mistakes .
the government is responsible for all the bloodshed , tears and victims .
they took over this country with zero terrorism in 2002 , but today Turkey has turned into a blood@@ b@@ ath .
who is responsible for them ?
the taxi driver Ş@@ eh@@ mu@@ z in Diyarbak@@ ır ?
for what does Turkey pay the price ?
we will participate genuinely in the meetings to change the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at laws , we will offer our opinions .
we won &apos;t let anybody build a country on their personal views .
I say , &quot; Let &apos;s change the pro @-@ coup mindset . &quot;
the houses of this country &apos;s intellectuals are raided and they are taken into custody because they gave their opinion .
there are parts of what they say we do not agree with , but people should be able to offer their opinions freely .
this tin@@ pot dictator says , &quot; Th@@ ose who benefit from the state , treat it as an enemy . &quot;
I would also like to ask him ; those who benefit from the state , and use all the opportunities of the state , why don &apos;t they think about it when they rob the country ?
CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country .
we will make preparations together for the fourth biggest revolution .
we will definitely bring liber@@ tar@@ ian democracy to this country no matter what it costs .
they may detain us , they may take us into custody ; CHP will bring freedom to this country no matter what they do , no matter how heavy the price .
I &apos;m making a clear , straight call to you , Dav@@ u@@ to@@ ğlu .
do not hide behind the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at laws , those who hide behind them do not ban@@ ish from one &apos;s mind the coup mentality .
you gave a mer@@ it@@ orious service medal to someone who gave a warning to you .
which coup are you talking about ?
it is completely aimed at deceiving the people .
party officials listed the other 3 revol@@ utions as follows : the 1st big revolution is the foundation of the Republic by putting an end to the sul@@ tan@@ ate ; the 2nd big revolution is the passing from the single party era to the multi @-@ party era in the time of İ@@ n@@ ön@@ ü ; the 3rd big revolution is passing into social democracy with B@@ ü@@ lent Ecevit ...
there are qualifications and duties of the President .
there is a President &apos;s oath in article 103 .
we know how important the concepts of honesty and honour are in this society .
if someone comes out and gives this promise , they should keep their word to the death .
because honesty and honour are in@@ disputable for us .
what do honesty and honour mean for you , tin@@ pot dictator ?
what do you understand from honesty and honour , why did you take this oath ?
what do honesty and honour mean to you ?
I want to learn this .
the concepts of honesty and honour are held in high este@@ em by religious people .
their intention is not to abolish the law of the coup , but to forti@@ fy the law of the coup .
it does not suffice and they want the presidential system .
what kind of presidency ; it is a presidential system with a boss .
why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system ?
one person commands and everybody does what is necessary .
do we have a healthy parliament in Turkey that works ?
no , it does not work .
if we bring liber@@ tar@@ ian democracy , the system will work .
they repeatedly say coup but they are strengthening the law of the coup .
declaring his nomination for candidacy of the general presidency , İ@@ z@@ mir Deputy Mustafa Bal@@ bay could not join the race because he could not gather the signatures of 128 delegates necessary for the candidacy .
gathering 92 signatures , Bal@@ bay said , &quot; I am not able to become a candidate under present conditions . &quot;
the thing that attracted attention was that the previous CHP leader Deniz Baykal sat in the tri@@ bun@@ es with party members instead of the seats allocated to deputies and members of the party council ( PM ) , the central executive board ( MYK ) and honorary board .
Istanbul deputy G@@ ü@@ lay Y@@ ed@@ ek@@ çi arrived early and sat near the section allocated to the General President K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu instead of sitting in the area allocated to the deputies .
one of the things most spoken about in the back@@ stage of the congress was the conversation between Kl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu and the Yal@@ ova deputy Muharrem İ@@ n@@ ce .
İ@@ n@@ ce explained that membership of the party council was offered to him , but he did not accept it .
however , sources from central office claim that the meeting request came from İ@@ n@@ ce and membership of the party council was not offered to him .
In@@ ce shared a message on Twitter , &quot; No matter who they are , the sources from the central office can get the details of the conversation from the Istanbul deputy Ali Ö@@ z@@ can . &quot;
Ö@@ z@@ can said , &quot; How can I know about the conversation between two people . &quot;
he only said , &quot; he went and spoke with him . &quot;
K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu &apos;s son applauded his &quot; father &quot; repeatedly .
the back@@ stage of the party council left its mark on the first day of the ordinary &quot; Congress of Democracy , Change and Bro@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
after his speech at the congress , K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu went to his home and started to work on the list of party council .
it was understood that while preparing the key list of 100 people , he called the 13 central executive board ( MYK ) members and said he would include them in the list ; except for the current central executive board members Y@@ ak@@ up Ak@@ kaya , S@@ enc@@ er Ay@@ ata and Ercan Karak@@ a@@ ş , who declared that they did not want to be on the executive and did not apply for the party council ( PM ) , and Sey@@ han Er@@ doğ@@ du , who applied once more to the party council .
it is stated that K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu may refer to another narrow list in addition to the 100 person @-@ key list of the party council .
in the 21 article @-@ final declaration , accepted unanimously at the CHP congress , the abolishment of the ann@@ ot@@ ation on the European Charter of Local Self @-@ Government was requested , which was brought into the agenda with the self government discussions of DTK , and the increase of the authority share in the local affairs .
In@@ cl@@ eded in the declaration were the aims of &quot; ending of the party state system &quot; and &quot; establishment of a transparent and accountable rule of law . &quot;
Vice Chairman of the AK Party Sel@@ ç@@ uk Ö@@ zd@@ a@@ ğ , İ@@ dr@@ is Bal@@ uk@@ en from H@@ DP and Ru@@ h@@ sa@@ r Dem@@ i@@ rel from MHP watched the congress .
AK Party member Ö@@ zd@@ a@@ ğ and the delegation from the AK Party left the hall when K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu harshly criticized President Er@@ doğan .
Ö@@ zd@@ a@@ ğ said , &quot; I saw that he knows no boundaries of critici@@ zing , it was not possible for me to accept it . &quot;
the banner with photos of the arrested journalists Can D@@ ü@@ n@@ dar and Erdem G@@ ül and the text &quot; If I don &apos;t burn , if you don &apos;t burn , if we don &apos;t burn , how will the light van@@ qu@@ ish the dar@@ kness ? , &quot; and the banner of &quot; Peace &quot; in English , Turkish and Kurdish attracted attention in the hall .
the congress started in the morning with the songs of Group Yor@@ um and Ahmet Kaya .
there was big applause for the message sent by Tür@@ kan El@@ çi , wife of the Bar president of Diyarbak@@ ır Tah@@ ir El@@ çi , who was killed in an armed assault .
Ber@@ kin El@@ van &apos;s mother G@@ ü@@ l@@ s@@ ü@@ m and father Sami El@@ van also participated in the congress .
the most applauded part of the speech was the part in which K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu said that they will embrace democracy &quot; to the death &quot; no matter what price they have to pay .
having assembled 34 ordinary and 18 extraordinary congres@@ ses , 52 congres@@ ses in total until now , CHP assembled the 53rd big congress in Ankara Arena yesterday .
participation was high .
there were more than 15 thousand CHP members in the hall with a capacity of 12 thousand seats .
however , the crowd didn &apos;t do justice to this number with their enthusiasm .
the most exciting moment was the moment in which K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu entered the hall with his wife Sel@@ vi K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu .
the excitement continued when the K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu couple greeted the hall with a wave .
there is no trace of the discipline seen in the congres@@ ses of the AK Party .
there was a lot of movement in the ground area of the arena even when K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu was making speech .
it was obvious that the CHP members , wanting to enter the Party Council , preferred to seek support by talking about themselves to party executives and journalists .
one of the CHP executives tried to explain that this situation was not a bad thing by saying , &quot; It is better than sitting down without moving and lining up the walk @-@ on party members as in the party meetings of Korea or the Soviet Union . &quot;
the CHP congress has one more difference from the congres@@ ses of the AK Party or MHP .
in these parties , only the general president talks .
in CHP , the congress becomes a platform in which the problems of the party are discussed .
when the number of party members wanting to speak increased , Council Chairman Murat Kar@@ ay@@ al@@ ç@@ ın had difficulty in adjusting the time .
there was the expression &quot; The homeland goes bad &quot; in their faces , and there was a distance to the comments &quot; You will then change this course of events with the result coming from this hall . &quot;
all the CHP members said , &quot; Som@@ eth@@ ing should be done , &quot; but there wasn &apos;t a strong and coherent answer to the question of &quot; What should be done . &quot;
the fact that there will be no election in the next 4 years had a big effect on the situation .
when K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu went up to the ro@@ str@@ um , we journalists waited for his answer to the question &quot; What should be done . &quot;
firstly , K@@ ı@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ o@@ ğlu answered the question &quot; what is going on . &quot;
he highlighted the issue of the arrested journalists , what was done to academics because of the declaration , what took place in the southeast , the deadlock that foreign policy has come to .
he repeatedly answered the &quot; legends of Anatolia &quot; issue related to his CHP party , such as , &quot; it is a party of non @-@ believers , &quot; &quot; it supports coups d &apos;@@ é@@ tat &quot; and &quot; it is the party of el@@ iti@@ sts . &quot;
when it comes to the &quot; What should be done &quot; stage , he tried to put forward a &quot; strategy &quot; rather than discussing concrete steps .
he stressed that all of these problems could be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice .
he gave a promise on behalf of CHP and said , &quot; We will work no matter what it costs until we bring democracy . &quot;
&quot; we will struggle to the death for democracy . &quot;
one last note : it is necessary to remember that CHP have solved the issue of &quot; organization &quot; as of the 53rd congress , and it now succeeds in assembling a congress without problem .
on another note , cards were printed for 900 journalists said to be attending the congress , but journalist participation in the hall was not at that level .
representatives of media organizations from Ankara were not as eager as they were for the congres@@ ses of the AK Party .
life sentence was demanded for autonomy
the indictment , prepared by the Chief Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office against 7 suspects , 3 of whom are in detention , was accepted by the 4th High Criminal Court .
in the indictment , it was stated that declarations under the name of &quot; autonomy &quot; were made in some districts and neighbourhoods of Diyarbak@@ ır , İ@@ stan@@ bul , Ş@@ ı@@ r@@ nak , Mar@@ din , Mu@@ ş , Hakkari , Siirt , Bit@@ lis , Bat@@ man , Van and A@@ ğ@@ r@@ ı upon the directions and calls by senior executives of the terrorist organization PKK / KCK .
indicating that there were calls for illegal actions by the ring@@ leaders and the youth and woman formations of the organization , the indictment noted that there was an increase in the actions of bombing , long bar@@ rel@@ led weapon and rocket laun@@ cher attacks on the security forces , public institutions and organizations and people &apos;s houses , workplaces and vehicles in the Su@@ r , Ba@@ ğ@@ lar , Sil@@ van , B@@ ism@@ il , L@@ ice , Dicle and Haz@@ ro districts of Diyarbak@@ ır .
Is@@ is clashed with opponents ; our police station was hit
the clashes recently seen between Is@@ is and the Army of Con@@ quest , formed by a group of rebel militi@@ as , are becoming violent and continue in the Syrian villages of Du@@ di@@ yan , Q@@ ar@@ ah Maz@@ r &apos;@@ ah , Bag@@ h@@ id@@ in and Q@@ ar@@ ah Ku@@ br@@ i on the opposite side of the Yav@@ uz@@ lu village of Kil@@ is .
during the clashes between Is@@ is and its opponents close to the border , gunfire and the noise of mor@@ t@@ ars can also be heard in Turkey .
coming from the region in which explosions occur frequently , smoke could be seen from Turkey with the n@@ aked eye , and security forces took concentrated precautions with armoured cars on the border .
on the other hand , harassment fire was opened from the Bag@@ h@@ id@@ in village under the control of Is@@ is militants at the Mar@@ ty@@ r Mehmet Police St@@ ation on the border near the Yav@@ uz@@ lu Village in Kil@@ is .
then , soldiers responded to the area from which the harassment fire was coming , with ho@@ wit@@ zer and heavy guns within the rules of engagement .
according to claims , Russian warplanes organized an attack on the village of H@@ ame@@ y@@ in , which is 17 kilometres from the Turkish border .
wounded by the a@@ erial bombing , 6 Syrians were brought to the state hospital of Kil@@ is by relatives .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by heading to the settings ap@@ p , tapping &quot; General , &quot; and then selecting &quot; Software update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to down@@ load and then install it .
some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that &quot; Software update failed . &quot;
to get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down , or to try and upgrade through i@@ Tun@@ es .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
that might include del@@ eting Ap@@ ps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by sl@@ imming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest Ap@@ ps to del@@ ete and then re @-@ install them once the process is over .
it &apos;s worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charg@@ er while the update happens , so that it doesn &apos;t run out of bat@@ tery .
if the charge is too low , Apple won &apos;t let the update go ahead , since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking .

Fed@@ E@@ x earnings mixed , lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
Fed@@ E@@ x reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full @-@ year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , Fed@@ E@@ x announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday &apos;s opening bell .
Fed@@ E@@ x Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes aver@@ aging 4.9 percent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost @-@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was &quot; performing solid@@ ly given weaker @-@ than @-@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the holiday @-@ hiring plans were announced a day after rival U@@ PS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
in the quarter that ended Aug@@ . 31 , Fed@@ E@@ x earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.3 billion .
six analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted results at Fed@@ E@@ x Ground .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs .
in pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bell , Fed@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
they closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27 @-@ foot Hond@@ uran m@@ ah@@ og@@ any table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
looming over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s orn@@ ate , two @-@ story boar@@ dro@@ om will be a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that Fed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ell@@ en and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maxim@@ ize U@@ .S. employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a too @-@ close @-@ to @-@ predict decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U@@ .S. economy is ready to start being we@@ aned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing solid@@ ly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already @-@ cautious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ tish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M@@ . Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economist at bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fe@@ l Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , &quot; she said .
there &apos;s no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
about half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 99.@@ 85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; it would be a surprise if the Fed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , &quot; he said .
if Fed policymakers did , &quot; they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would valid@@ ate the strength of the U@@ .S. recovery .
Y@@ ell@@ en had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slowed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of picking up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ t@@ ness of the labor market , &quot; said Ian She@@ ph@@ er@@ d@@ son , chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on macro@@ economics .
but financial markets around the world started conv@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China deval@@ ued its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has reb@@ ounded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for Fed policymakers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calcul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
&quot; absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , a senior research fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Z@@ iman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official .
now , he predicts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U@@ .S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post @-@ dates the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the health of the global economy isn &apos;t one of the Fed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it shouldn &apos;t be factored into its decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
the mere h@@ int by then @-@ Chairman Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the Fed might &quot; t@@ aper &quot; its monetary expansion triggered market conv@@ ul@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision @-@ making process is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of global strategy for wealth @-@ management firm En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Ric@@ h@@ mond , V@@ a . , noted this month that &quot; the Fed has a history of over@@ reacting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundamentals . &quot;
L@@ acker , a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998 @-@ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings &quot; despite limited identi@@ fiable implications for U@@ .S. growth , &quot; L@@ acker said .
a year later , Fed officials reversed those cuts .
the Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s rate @-@ setting committee .
the latest turmoil doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

Brazil &apos;s Ped@@ iatric Society of R@@ io Gr@@ and@@ e promotes healthy Bre@@ ast@@ feeding Die@@ ts
Brazilian ped@@ iatric organization SP@@ RS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breast@@ feeding , by featuring images of babies suc@@ k@@ ling from bre@@ asts painted with dep@@ ictions of un@@ healthy food .
human breast milk is composed of a variety of prote@@ ins , f@@ ats , vit@@ am@@ ins , and car@@ bo@@ hy@@ dr@@ ates , which give babies all the nutri@@ ents they need to grow a strong immune system .
due to excess energy requirements , pregnant women and new m@@ oms are advised to increase their daily cal@@ or@@ ie in@@ take by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ or@@ ie in@@ take is not the only di@@ etary adjustment mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , a professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy di@@ ets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy di@@ ets were found to negatively affect the child &apos;s immune system .

&quot; Sar@@ ah is really down to earth , she &apos;s so much fun to be around , &quot; added Mark@@ oski .

J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options of where to begin his N@@ F@@ L career .
Det@@ ro@@ it and Se@@ attle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 4@@ 9@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sula and it &apos;s looking like a wise decision .
some coaches would have ben@@ ched Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game for losing a f@@ um@@ ble like the A@@ ussi@@ e r@@ ug@@ by league convert did on his first pun@@ t return in Tuesday &apos;s 20 @-@ 3 win against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sula showed faith in his man , giving Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a pun@@ t and including him in the running game after an injury to Re@@ gg@@ ie Bush .
Tom@@ sula continued to show his true colours in the loc@@ ker room after the game .
instead of ch@@ ew@@ ing out his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sula also backed Hay@@ ne publicly in his post @-@ match press conference .
4@@ 9@@ ers beat reporter C@@ am In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also received encouragement from special teams co @-@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .
J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne f@@ um@@ bles a pun@@ t that was recovered by the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings during the first quarter
it was certainly not the start Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his N@@ F@@ L debut .

&quot; it was just one of those things , you just worry about the next play and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .

4 Killed After Police Fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nep@@ al
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nep@@ al after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u , the capital .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and fi@@ reb@@ om@@ bs .
Mr. D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bullets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less @-@ lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nep@@ al &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dil@@ ute their political influence .
there have also been protests in western Nep@@ al from ethnic Th@@ ar@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Aug@@ .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nep@@ al , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday .

the donations will go toward four non@@ profit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Borders , International Res@@ c@@ ue Committee , S@@ ave the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.5 million worth of donations globally at go@@ og@@ le@@ .com / refuge@@ ere@@ li@@ ef until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four @-@ year @-@ old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
many are also fleeing war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with type 2 di@@ abe@@ tes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it &apos;s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with di@@ abe@@ tes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments , however .
&quot; the mortality data take a long time to show up , &quot; said Dr. Rob@@ in Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss operations , or bar@@ iatric surgery , use various methods to shrink the size of the stom@@ ach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , bar@@ iatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 di@@ abe@@ tes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bid@@ ly ob@@ ese , with a body mass index ( B@@ MI ) of 35 or above .
B@@ MI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18@@ .5 and 2@@ 4.9 .
a B@@ MI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ MI over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your B@@ MI here : 1.@@ u@@ sa@@ .gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s M@@ in @-@ Sh@@ en@@ g General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bar@@ iatric surgery - g@@ ast@@ ric bypass and sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 di@@ abe@@ tes in people who were mil@@ dly ob@@ ese .
the average B@@ MI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the B@@ MI among those receiving non @-@ surgical di@@ abe@@ tes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , di@@ abe@@ tes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
in the med@@ ically @-@ treated group , by comparison , di@@ abe@@ tes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ cer@@ ides , and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ D@@ L ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol &quot; was generally better in the surgical group , &quot; the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of h@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
Hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average h@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gl@@ y@@ c@@ emic control &quot; - as reflected by the improved h@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Chen@@ g HS@@ U and colleagues .
the research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs 14.2 kg ) , achieved larger drops in B@@ MI ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and in h@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete di@@ abe@@ tes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.9 percent vs 16.@@ 7 percent ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Ariz@@ ona College of Medicine @-@ Pho@@ eni@@ x .
in the Swedish study , ob@@ ese people who had bar@@ iatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study didn &apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s reassuring for people with a B@@ MI under 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower B@@ MI group , &quot; with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s B@@ MI falls between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &quot; she said .
I think that once they &apos;ve accumulated these genetic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into ob@@ es@@ ity and di@@ abe@@ tes , reversing that is really hard .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dal@@ ai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Ti@@ be@@ tan Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents .
he also stressed that , however admir@@ able , the West @-@ European countries &quot; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
&quot; it it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dal@@ ai Lama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; so taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphas@@ ized .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the Dal@@ ai Lama also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US &quot; violent response eng@@ en@@ dered a chain of un@@ control@@ la@@ ble events .
after 9 / 11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non @-@ violence .
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama said .
four@@ fold increase in children ing@@ est@@ ing hand san@@ itiz@@ er in last 4 years
poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 @-@ percent up@@ tic@@ k since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 sw@@ allowing highly @-@ alcoholic hand san@@ itiz@@ er , according to the Georgia poison Center .
according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia poison Center , hand san@@ itiz@@ er ing@@ estion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,@@ 2@@ 66 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &quot; Lop@@ ez told CNN .
he said some kids are drinking san@@ itiz@@ er intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or on a social @-@ media dare .
videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking san@@ itiz@@ er for a cheap buzz .
teens have reportedly mixed san@@ itiz@@ er with alcohol @-@ containing mouth@@ wash for a stiffer drink .
younger children can be drawn to attractive san@@ itiz@@ er sc@@ ents .
&quot; a k@@ id is not thinking this is bad for them , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
a lot of the more attractive ( hand san@@ itiz@@ ers ) are the ones that are sc@@ ented .
there are str@@ aw@@ berry , grap@@ e , orange @-@ fla@@ vo@@ red hand san@@ itiz@@ ers that are very appealing to kids .
hand san@@ itiz@@ er contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squ@@ irts can cause alcohol poisoning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison control center at University of Kan@@ sas Hospital , told Fox 4 in Kan@@ sas City .
so you wouldn &apos;t leave a shot of wh@@ is@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand san@@ itiz@@ ers out and if kids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently ing@@ est@@ ed as many as four squ@@ irts of str@@ aw@@ berry @-@ sc@@ ented hand san@@ itiz@@ er at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered legally dr@@ unk in an adult , according to Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ win@@ net@@ t Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain trauma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; Or@@ tor@@ ia Scot@@ t , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , told CNN .
it could have been very lethal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ alcoholic products or san@@ itiz@@ ing wi@@ pes short of moving hand san@@ itiz@@ er out of a child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol poisoning , some san@@ itiz@@ ers have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two On@@ tar@@ io women died after sw@@ allowing hand san@@ itiz@@ er that contained a toxic , undeclared ingredi@@ ent .
health officials sur@@ mised that the product contained me@@ than@@ ol , a deadly agent , rather than eth@@ y@@ l alcohol , which was listed as the active ingredi@@ ent .
in January , three fourth @-@ grade students in up@@ state New York plotted to poison their &quot; mean &quot; teacher &quot; by putting anti@@ bac@@ terial products around the classroom , &quot; according to a police report .
the teacher is highly all@@ erg@@ ic to hand san@@ itiz@@ er and banned it from her room .
police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be &quot; idle chat@@ ter , &quot; referring discipline to the school district .

they become a shield for the killer .
they hide him .
once out of sight , they tell everybody that actually he is not guilty .
the sides are very clear in the fight we have experienced for the last 10 years .

Saudi Arabia did not give up on T@@ Ü@@ B@@ İ@@ TAK
stating that a new agreement was made with Saudi Arabia for the second batch sale of Ball@@ istic Image analysing and Rec@@ ogn@@ ition Systems ( B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA ) from the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey ( T@@ Ü@@ B@@ İ@@ TAK ) , F@@ ik@@ ri I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k , the Minister of Science , Industry and Technology said , &quot; the number of B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA to serve Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement covering the development and installation of an additional 8 systems . &quot;
I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k gave details about B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA , which was developed by the Space Technologies Research Institute of TU@@ B@@ İ@@ TAK .
explaining that the system provides a comparison of the ballistic exam@@ inations of guns , bullets and cas@@ ings with the data in the central database , I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k stated that the problems for ballistic specialists when examining cas@@ ings and bullets were therefore eliminated .
I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k expressed that the data obtained from different geographical locations and the accompanying information can be kept together and quer@@ ied thanks to B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA .
drawing attention to the fact that one of the most important features of B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA is its capability to allow three @-@ dimensional data to be obtained and shown which gives more details and less errors , I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k stresses that ball@@ istics specialists can make decisions more rapidly and their success rate increases thanks to the innovations offered by the system .
B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA was exported within the &quot; S@@ U@@ BA @-@ 1 Project &quot;
underlining that B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA meets all the criteria of success and received full marks from the General Directorate of Security , I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k noted that all of Turkey is encomp@@ assed by the system , established in 10 different regions , with Ankara in first place .
mentioning that the system was opened to foreign markets because of its success , I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k said that B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA was exported within the scope of the &quot; S@@ U@@ BA @-@ 1 Project &quot; realised with Saudi Arabia and its installation was completed with success in 6 different regions in 2013 .
I@@ ş@@ ı@@ k stated that a new agreement was done for the second batch sale of B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA to Saudi Arabia , and S@@ U@@ BA @-@ 2 was signed as the follow @-@ up of S@@ U@@ BA @-@ 1 , and said that the number of B@@ AL@@ İ@@ ST@@ İ@@ KA to serve Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement including the development and installation of 8 additional systems .
a bus @-@ sized cro@@ c@@ od@@ ile fossil was found
it was reported that the salt water cro@@ c@@ od@@ ile from the prehistoric age has a length of approximately 10 metres and weighed 3 tonnes .
just the length of the cro@@ c@@ od@@ ile &apos;s sk@@ ull was measured as 1.6 metres .
the researchers named the species &quot; Mac@@ him@@ os@@ aur@@ us re@@ x &quot; and published their findings in the magazine Cret@@ ac@@ eous Research .
the lead author of the article , Feder@@ ico F@@ anti from Bologna University , stated that the fossil was understood to date from 130 million years ago and &quot; it is nearly the size of a bus . &quot;
speaking to the Washington Post , F@@ anti said that the huge salt water cro@@ c@@ od@@ ile &quot; was at the top of the food chain at least in a certain region , during that age . &quot;
pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ologists stated that M@@ . re@@ x , believed to be the biggest cro@@ c@@ od@@ ile living in the sea , hun@@ ted in lag@@ oons by lying in wait .
it is thought that the biggest fresh water cro@@ c@@ od@@ ile in history is the &quot; Sar@@ cos@@ u@@ ch@@ us imper@@ ator , &quot; which lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could reach 12 metres in length and 8 tonnes in weight .
all their minds are very confused !
the first book from writer E@@ ce Temel@@ k@@ uran published in 1996 , &quot; All the Women &apos;s Min@@ ds Are confused &quot; was adapted for theatre with the same name by the Ay@@ sa Production Theatre .
Sel@@ en U@@ ç@@ er directs the play in which Deniz Ç@@ ak@@ ır , Zey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ k@@ on@@ de , İ@@ pek Türk@@ tan Kay@@ nak , Kadir Ç@@ er@@ m@@ ik and Ş@@ eb@@ nem S@@ ön@@ mez play a part .
U@@ ç@@ er , whose plays &quot; Po@@ z &quot; and &quot; Kur@@ u S@@ ı@@ k@@ ı &quot; are still ongoing , had her first experience of script writing and directing in the play , which questions the confusion in women &apos;s minds .
the play was introduced to an audience in the Trum@@ p Performance Centre last week .
the play opens with a radio play .
a voice in the dark , taking us back to past years ...
then the cur@@ tain goes up .
a woman , who is sitting on a window l@@ edge , is on the verge of jumping .
who she is and why she is trying to commit suicide are understood after the intervention of the next @-@ door neighbours .
she left A letter
&quot; E@@ br@@ u U@@ ys@@ al , &quot; played by Deniz Ç@@ ak@@ ır , is a popular writer .
she was left by her husband , but this is not the only reason .
there are some things that have accumulated inside her .
she was brought to this moment because of the fact that she did not enjoy pat@@ ern@@ al love , her childhood was spent in lon@@ el@@ iness , and the fact that she thinks that she is not understood .
she decided to commit suicide , left a letter behind , but she cannot jump from the window .
because &quot; Aysel &quot; ( Zey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ k@@ on@@ de ) , the pr@@ att@@ ling , g@@ ulli@@ ble cleaner and next @-@ door neighbour , and &quot; Per@@ ran &quot; ( Ş@@ eb@@ nem S@@ ön@@ mez ) , the mysterious woman in the opposite flat , draw her into conversation .
they approach the situation as if it were a normal , ordinary situation .
the woman becomes more stressed ; she could not concentrate and jump .
when the famous singer &quot; Mel@@ tem Kaya &quot; ( İ@@ pek Türk@@ tan Kay@@ nak ) , who is having her home cleaned , joins the conversation between the three , the situation turns into a cl@@ am@@ our of voices .
approaching the situation with her naive and sincere style , &quot; Mel@@ tem &quot; cannot help but sing when she sees a crowd .
this interesting attempt at suicide takes on a different dimension with the appearance of real estate agent &quot; Murat &quot; ( Kadir Ç@@ er@@ m@@ ik ) with a spare key .
the situation gets out of hand when the singer &quot; Mel@@ tem &quot; gives very in@@ accurate information to the press .
the song &quot; Sok@@ ak K@@ ı@@ z@@ ı &quot; by Naz@@ an Ö@@ n@@ cel is also used in the play .
comedy of depression
directing on the stage for the first time , U@@ ç@@ er was successful in ensuring the temp@@ o and flow of the play .
Zey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ k@@ on@@ de and İ@@ pek Türk@@ tan Kay@@ nak carry the burden of comedy in the play .
the exaggerated characters played by this duo succeed in making the audience laugh with both their mim@@ ics and lines .
while Ş@@ eb@@ nem S@@ ön@@ mez conve@@ ys her years of experience on the stage very well , Deniz Ç@@ ak@@ ır delivers a persu@@ as@@ ive performance in reflecting the depressed mood of &quot; E@@ br@@ u U@@ ys@@ al . &quot;
making an ind@@ el@@ ible impression with his performance in Tol@@ ga Ç@@ el@@ ik &apos;s award @-@ winning film &quot; Sar@@ ma@@ ş@@ ı@@ k , &quot; Kadir Ç@@ er@@ m@@ ik successfully ac@@ companies these four women .
defined as a comedy of depression , the one @-@ act play promises to make you laugh without confusing the mind .
here is what stayed in my mind from these beautiful words mostly coming from the mouth of &quot; Per@@ ran , &quot; played by Ş@@ eb@@ nem S@@ ön@@ mez : do not s@@ cri@@ b@@ ble hastily , they will read it ; do not live hastily , they will see you .
most children possibly thought of dying to punish their fathers and mothers , and they somehow ended up crying at the thought .
the woman is hanging in the air like an un@@ realised jo@@ ke .
the woman searches for a funny story that she has always forgotten a part of .
in fact , every story begins with a kind of being abandonment .
I should put my hands into my pocket , I cannot stand anything without pockets .
people do not know where to put their hands .
since we do not know it , our hands multi@@ ply .
people bad@@ mouth what they do not know ; they fabric@@ ate and fabric@@ ate .
a misunderstanding becomes reality .
all the women &apos;s heads are confused because they are m@@ essed up by someone .
if you are not able to die , you have a chance to live .
&quot; drink ke@@ f@@ ir and live longer &quot;
it can be consumed safely at any age
expressing that one of the nutri@@ ents that can be consumed safely by everyone of every age is ke@@ f@@ ir , a mirac@@ ulous nutri@@ ent which is more beneficial than its main base of milk and whose health benefits are completely un@@ coun@@ table , the specialist di@@ e@@ tic@@ ian P@@ ın@@ ar Kur@@ al En@@ ç said that , &quot; It is more nutri@@ tious than yog@@ hurt because it includes prote@@ in , basic minerals and vit@@ amin B. &quot;
it is rich in vit@@ amin B1 , B@@ 12 and K.
thanks to its cal@@ ci@@ um and magn@@ es@@ ium content , it creates the basis for a healthy nervous system .
it is also a good source of phos@@ phor@@ ous .
in addition , having the feature of feeling full , ke@@ f@@ ir does not make you gain weight .
she said , &quot; its nutri@@ tional value is high and it is a dig@@ esti@@ ble drink . &quot;
cure @-@ all
explaining that children , the elderly , expec@@ tant mothers and women entering the period of men@@ op@@ ause can consume ke@@ f@@ ir without hesitation , the specialist di@@ e@@ tic@@ ian P@@ ın@@ ar Kur@@ al En@@ ç said , &quot; K@@ ef@@ ir is originally a local drink made in the Caucasus . &quot;
however it started to become famous around the world .
being the secret of you@@ th@@ ful@@ ness and an eli@@ x@@ ir for a long an healthy life , ke@@ f@@ ir c@@ ures nearly all conditions .
K@@ ef@@ ir is one of the most natural ways to protect babies from Met@@ abol@@ ic illnesses .

the activities of pro@@ bio@@ tics have an important effect as much as our liver , and if they are consumed sufficiently they prevent detrimental micro @-@ organis@@ ms in the inte@@ st@@ ines from sticking and spreading to the inte@@ st@@ inal wall .
Im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment of the balance of healthy micro @-@ organis@@ ms in the inte@@ st@@ ine causes disease .
the health of the dig@@ esti@@ ve tract should be protected through proper nour@@ ishment .
to do this , we should certainly consume a sufficient amount of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
it resolves all these problems found in the inte@@ st@@ ine

Met@@ e Kal@@ k@@ avan will serve as the referee for the match which starts at 20 : 00 at the Ba@@ ş@@ ak@@ ş@@ ehir Fatih Terim Stadium .
winning the last 4 matches before the Super League &apos;s mid @-@ season break , the white @-@ black team wants to both increase its winning series to 5 matches and maintain its lead by beating Mersin İ@@ d@@ man Y@@ ur@@ du in front of their supporters .

in the Ziraat Turkish Cup during the mid @-@ season break , facing off twice against 14@@ 61 Trabzon , one of the teams in the PT@@ T 1st league , and picking different squads in these matches , the experienced manager will return to his ideal 11 in the Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du match .
while it is expected that İ@@ sm@@ ail K@@ ö@@ y@@ ba@@ ş@@ ı , having been injured in the last match against the Black Sea representatives , will be assigned a place among the first 11 , it was reported that G@@ ü@@ ne@@ ş plans to give Ol@@ c@@ ay Ş@@ ah@@ an his jer@@ sey in the midfield position .

3 footballers at the penalty limit
3 footballers are at the penalty limit of yellow cards for Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş before the match against Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du .
if Mario G@@ om@@ ez , Lu@@ iz Rhod@@ ol@@ f@@ o or Andreas Bec@@ k , each with three yellow cards in the Super League , are shown a yellow card during the match against Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du , they will not be able to play in the away match against Trab@@ z@@ on@@ sp@@ or , to be played in the 19th week .
Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş &apos;s tr@@ ump card is G@@ om@@ ez
all eyes will be on German footballer Mario G@@ om@@ ez in the match Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş will play against Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du .
having scored against these opponents in the last 4 league matches wearing the white @-@ black jer@@ sey , the 31 year @-@ old footballer hit the top in the top sc@@ orers ranking with his performances .
having played in all the matches in the first half of the league and scoring in 10 of them , G@@ om@@ ez has 13 goals in the league .
meanwhile , Cen@@ k Tos@@ un , another Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş goal scorer , scored 3 goals in the away match against Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du in the first half of the league , and completed his first hat @-@ trick in his professional career .
12 of the last 15 matches won
Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş won 12 of the last 15 matches it played in the Super League .

&quot; scoring &quot; and &quot; conceding &quot; teams face off
the match between Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş and Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du will pit the highest scoring and the team that concedes most in this Super League season .
having scored 41 goals in the first half of the season , the white @-@ bl@@ acks are in the position of the highest scoring team .
having conceded 36 goals in a 17 week @-@ period , Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du is one of two teams who concede most in the league alongside E@@ sk@@ i@@ ş@@ eh@@ ir@@ sp@@ or , sharing last place on the rankings table .
Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş defeated its opponent 5 @-@ 2 in the match between these two teams that was played in the first half of the season and witnessed 7 goals .
manager crisis in Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du
in the mid @-@ season break there was a manager crisis experienced in Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du , who couldn &apos;t finish the first half of the Super League in their desired position .
having finished the first half of the season under the management of B@@ ü@@ lent Kor@@ k@@ maz , Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du par@@ ted company with the 48 year @-@ old manager on the first day of the start of camp .
brought in as head of the red @-@ navy blues instead of Kor@@ k@@ maz , Hakan Kut@@ lu remained as head of the team , which he had managed before , for only one day .
an agreement was made with the manager Nur@@ ullah Sa@@ ğ@@ lam after the Mersin İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du general meeting , which held an extraordinary general meeting during the mid @-@ season break and elected H@@ ü@@ se@@ y@@ in Ç@@ al@@ ı@@ ş@@ kan as the president ; but the 50 year @-@ old manager remained at the head of the team for only 2 days .
Mes@@ in İ@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ du will take to the field against Be@@ ş@@ ik@@ ta@@ ş without a manager because they have not made an agreement with anyone after Nur@@ ullah Sa@@ ğ@@ lam .

consumer confidence is at a peak in the last 7 months in the U@@ .S.

Putin e@@ ats his words
while Russia is preparing to recognise the status of &quot; able to do business with Russia &quot; for Turkish companies if it cannot replace the services offered by Turkey , the head of the Russian Tour Oper@@ ators Union stated , &quot; Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey . &quot;
calculating that cutting current economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia , the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia prepared a new &quot; exceptional cases &quot; bill for the Russian Government regarding Turkey .
according to the proposal , published in the Russian Federal Regulation , giving permission to Turkish companies and firms is allowed when it becomes necessary even in the area of sanctions .
according to the proposal , goods and services from Turkish companies and firms will be used in cases where it is impossible to provide them from sources other than Turkey and domestic production in Russia brings serious additional costs .
the committee formed within the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia with other related ministries will determine which services and goods of Turkish origin will be included in this category .
therefore , officials will select and decide which Turkish companies will be able to work with Russia .
moreover , according to this document , state organizations and private companies in Russia will have to prove that there is no Russian equivalent for the business they will do with Turkish partners .
in the case that the proposal is approved by the Russian government and takes effect , the preferred Turkish companies will be registered in Russia .
the Russian Tour Oper@@ ators Union expressed that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey in the explanation it made yesterday .
the explanation includes the following : &quot; in spite of the ban on the sale of tours and the advice of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia to not go to Turkey , our citizens have started to search for ways to organ@@ ize their holiday by themselves . &quot;
the number of the posts titled &quot; the most practical and the cheapest way to take a holiday in Turkey &quot; keeps snow@@ ball@@ ing in social media on the internet .
the most widespread advice is to make online hotel reservations and to fly with Turkish Airlines .
the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev defined the oil price falling under 30 dollars as a &quot; dramati@@ cal development &quot; from Russia &apos;s viewpoint .
Medvedev said , &quot; N@@ ob@@ ody thought that petroleum would fall under 30 dollars and it was also a big surprise for our government . &quot;
he said , &quot; A@@ t this rate , it seems impossible to implement the budget as is now . &quot;
we passed the last month of 2015 .
after the shot @-@ down plane crisis , Russian President Putin announces that economic sanctions will be intensified .
in those days , our businessmen and our Turkish Airlines staff suffered a lot , trying to go to Russia in the usual way .
obstacles are set for Turkish goods at customs , and they are subjected to unthinkable checks .
1 month , not much , passes from then till now , and Ner@@ du@@ n Hac@@ ı@@ o@@ ğlu reports from Moscow yesterday .
one way or another , sanctions are being eased one by one .
all right , but why ?
the reason is simple .
it is because the closing of border crossings with the methods of a century ago and efforts to convert a political fight into an economic fight are no longer effective in an era when the economy has become so glob@@ alised .
look , we are continuing to write news about how the economic embargo implemented against Iran for many years was fl@@ ou@@ ted .
Russia and Turkey are countries that seem to have many allies but actually don &apos;t have so many , and they are dependent upon each other .
it is not technically possible to separate the two countries in one night , connected through their businessmen , tourists , entrepreneurs and customers .
if you close the doors , the people of these two countries will enter each other &apos;s countries from the ch@@ im@@ ney .
the most correct way is to have political discussion and to make terms at the table before the sanctions create new Re@@ za Z@@ arr@@ ab@@ s ( R@@ ı@@ za Sar@@ raf ) .
without involving the economics ...
hotel attack in Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o : 20 killed
it has been reported that at least 20 people were killed in the attack carried out with an explosives @-@ laden vehicle on the Hotel Spl@@ endid in Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o &apos;s capital O@@ u@@ ag@@ ad@@ ou@@ go@@ u .

it was reported that 63 hostages , including the Minister of Labour for Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , were rescued in the operation organized by the security forces and supported by French special forces ; 33 of which were injured .
it is not known how many hostages and attackers are in the 147 @-@ room hotel .
eye@@ witnesses said that two explosives @-@ laden vehicles exploded just outside the Hotel Spl@@ endid , preferred mostly by United Nations personnel and foreigners , and 3 @-@ 4 masked people entered the hotel .
upsetting news from Su@@ r : 1 mar@@ ty@@ r
severely wounded by the explosion from a hand @-@ made explosive set by terrorists yesterday in the Su@@ r district , in which the cur@@ few is in its 46th day , and taken to the Diyarbak@@ ır Military Hospital , police officer Ali Bul@@ duk could not be saved and died a mar@@ ty@@ r in spite of interventions .
it is understood that the mar@@ ty@@ r was registered in the civil registry of Adana .
residents of Diyarbak@@ ır did not support the terrorist protest !
according to the information obtained , a &quot; raise your voice &quot; protest against the operations was planned at 17 : 00 in the evening in front of the A@@ Z@@ C Pla@@ za in Ek@@ inc@@ il@@ er Street , in the O@@ f@@ is neighbourhood , Y@@ eni@@ ş@@ ehir district , Diyarbak@@ ır .
people did not participate in the protest in the desired numbers , to which residents were invited through brochures and appeals .
what drew most attention was that the citizens did not support the recent protests , whereas thousands of people participated in the previously organized protests .
not having the expected support in front of the A@@ Z@@ C Pla@@ za , the group dissolved without protesting because they were not supported by the Diyarbak@@ ır residents .
terrorists burned a school in Diyarbak@@ ır
according to the information obtained , the incident occu@@ red on 100@@ 7th street of the Yunus Emre neighbourhood in the central Ba@@ ğ@@ lar district .
entering the Nuri Zek@@ iye Has Sec@@ ond@@ ary School at around 19 : 30 , a group of terrorists with masked faces threw Molotov cocktails , set the building al@@ ight and fled .
when the building burst into flames , the people in the surrounding area notified the fire department .
the fire department called the police and asked them to take safety precautions before entering the area .
in response to this , many police were dispatched to the area with armoured vehicles .
once security measures had been taken , the fire teams extinguished the fire before it engulfed the entire building .
after that the police carried out crime scene investigations and a multi@@ fac@@ eted operation was launched to arrest the escaping terrorists .
meanwhile , some police officers at the scene of the incident helped journalists to take photos , but one officer tried to prevent the journalists from taking photos .
the ATM rob@@ bers were captured
police squads from the İ@@ z@@ mir Police Department started an operation after complaints that some people &apos;s bank cards were stolen and cash was withdrawn and money was spent from their accounts .
determining within the scope of the investigation that the perpetrators of the incident were M@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ G ( 43 ) and R@@ .@@ O ( 32 ) , the police discovered that the suspects cop@@ ied people &apos;s card information with the help of a &quot; card cop@@ ying mechanism &quot; and a &quot; mini camera &quot; they placed on AT@@ M@@ s in different provinces of Turkey .
it has been discovered that the suspects , after learning the card pass@@ words , then made transactions with these cards .
the suspects were taken into custody at the end of the operation .
examining the laptop computer used by M@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ G. and R@@ .@@ O , the squads recovered many video records from the mini camera mechanism set to obtain the pass@@ words of people making transactions in AT@@ M@@ s ; and they determined that the suspects stayed only for a short time in each province they visited in order to avoid arrest .
it was also revealed that the suspects made 50 thousand lira in illegal profits with the cop@@ ying operation which they used in 15 different AT@@ M@@ s in İ@@ z@@ mir .
the suspects were processed in the Police station , and then brought to court where they were detained in custody .
officials warned people against this kind of activity and to check their accounts regularly and to screen with their hands when entering pass@@ words at AT@@ M@@ s .
the Netherlands : Assad should be tried in the Hague
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands , Ber@@ t Ko@@ enders , stated that the Syrian President Bashar al @-@ Assad should be tried in the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) in the Hague .
making a speech in a conference he participated in at the Hague , Ko@@ enders stated that Assad is responsible for the refugee influx .
indicating that it is not possible to bring peace to Syria as long as Assad is in power , Ko@@ enders stated the following :
Assad should be tried in the ICC in the Hague .
someone with so many people &apos;s blood on his hands should be held accountable before the court .
in addition to this , Assad is solely responsible for the refugee influx we are now facing .
however , I am aware of the fact that Assad will not leave his post in the near future .
this matter should be talked about first and there is a need for Russia &apos;s help within this context .

Griff@@ iths plays down dis@@ harmony talk
it has sparked rumours of dis@@ harmony at Cel@@ tic , which was dismissed out of hand by Griff@@ iths , who insisted he and his team @-@ mates are not lab@@ ouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
lack of Sc@@ ots title race b@@ ores Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ ang@@ ers midfielder and ex @-@ Netherlands international Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic - because there &apos;s no title rivalry with R@@ ang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show highlights of the Cel@@ tic games any more and why ? &quot;
it is because R@@ ang@@ ers aren &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t only talk about R@@ ang@@ ers coming back .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams together and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I &apos;ll turn things around , vows De@@ ila

but De@@ ila said : &quot; Cel@@ tic have had bad periods before and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
that is the same as we are - but we have to go on .
we really , really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players much better .
to stay together now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton wary of January transfers
despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets , R@@ ang@@ ers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is wary of a signing spree , insisting he doesn &apos;t want to disrupt the I@@ bro@@ x squad &apos;s unity .
the ex @-@ B@@ ren@@ t@@ ford ga@@ ffer said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
in terms of players coming in the summer , you have that pre @-@ season period to bed them in , which you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the squad is doing really well .
sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

why I &apos;m A Witness A@@ t A@@ n Ex@@ ec@@ ution In Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
later today , barring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ itenti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ sip is executed by lethal injection .
he has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approaches , I &apos;ve come to dre@@ ad it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
whoever is picked will watch it dis@@ passion@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ los@@ sip &apos;s closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
one Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality .
here &apos;s the lesson .
tell the inmate &apos;s story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have phr@@ ased it better , &quot; but still thinks I &apos;m wrong to do what I &apos;m doing .
Richard G@@ los@@ sip has taken issue with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he did .
I &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
if he dies , he thinks the publicity will help the anti @-@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bel@@ l@@ ware , a reporter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I won &apos;t go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ sip is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an access@@ ory after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and it &apos;s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
man co@@ a@@ xed from c@@ anning River after s@@ og@@ gy police chase
the c@@ anning V@@ ale con@@ stable remained dry as he co@@ a@@ xed the man from the c@@ anning River .
a Per@@ th man &apos;s bid to lose a police tail came und@@ one after he found himself in sh@@ allow , mud@@ dy water just metres from a police officer trying to &quot; co@@ ax him g@@ ently back to shore . &quot;
c@@ anning V@@ ale police were called to a trespassing incident in Bec@@ ken@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the c@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; he was standing in the water saying &apos; I &apos;m not getting out , &apos; come and get me &apos; , &quot; Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine said .
Con@@ stable L@@ ach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec wasn &apos;t too keen on getting his uniform w@@ et , so he employed a safer tactic - &quot; good police negotiation . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try and escape , &quot; Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine said .
champion footballer Ben cousins provides a memorable example .
in 2006 , cousins d@@ it@@ ched his car to avoid a boo@@ ze bus and attempted to swim across the Sw@@ an River .
his efforts were unsuccessful , but did inspire locals to begin planning a tongue @-@ in @-@ che@@ ek Ben cousins biathlon .
Peter Moody alleges ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Rac@@ ing Victoria ste@@ wards attempted to plant a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately .
he took aim at ste@@ wards and Rac@@ ing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moody told F@@ air@@ fax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lid@@ ari &apos;s positive swa@@ b to cob@@ al@@ t , which he can not explain .
he had bit@@ ten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn &apos;t want it &quot; to look like sour grapes . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once , &quot; Moody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I &apos;m not that &apos;s when I shouldn &apos;t be a train@@ er .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
earlier , Moody had dropped the bomb@@ shell in a rac@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; Eighteen months ago Terry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ables to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moody said on Rac@@ ing@@ .com.
they obviously believe I &apos;m a che@@ at .
if that &apos;s the case surely they should all hand in their brief@@ s because they &apos;ve been incompetent in trying to catch me .
Robert R@@ oul@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of b@@ alls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I am .
maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I &apos;ve got no doubt what I &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
but I &apos;ve got to the point now where I don &apos;t care and that sadd@@ ens me .
that really sadd@@ ens me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I &apos;ve got the support of my family and I can walk away .
the train@@ er &apos;s frustration levels have built with the long @-@ running cob@@ al@@ t inquiry involving Lid@@ ari and the late scr@@ at@@ ching had him saying that he could &quot; throw my licence across the table . &quot;
Moody , best known for preparing un@@ beaten champion Black C@@ avi@@ ar , labelled the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a mud or clay poul@@ tice had been applied to the horses leg@@ s , which is against the rules .
it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I &apos;ve got to accept full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
one of my staff mistak@@ enly l@@ ac@@ ed mud on its leg .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the race day treatment using the poul@@ tice , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people making these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , &quot; Moody said .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bel@@ lam@@ y hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bel@@ lam@@ y has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by the N@@ RL &apos;s two premi@@ ership favourites .
Sydney Ro@@ os@@ ters coach T@@ rent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to &quot; wrest@@ le &quot; his side during the Storm &apos;s upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Br@@ on@@ cos coach W@@ ay@@ ne Ben@@ net@@ t made a thin@@ ly veiled reference to the Storm after his side &apos;s qualifying final win over North Qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and Cow@@ boys on Saturday night when he called that game a &quot; showcase &quot; of the r@@ ug@@ by league and said the two Qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and weren &apos;t &quot; too big &quot; into wrestling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y defended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tackling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them .
&quot; that keeps coming up - I didn &apos;t hear T@@ rent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24 @-@ 2 , &quot; Bel@@ lam@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven &apos;t changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us .
T@@ rent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it &apos;s funny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bel@@ lam@@ y challenged Ben@@ net@@ t &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; reminding his mentor that Ben@@ net@@ t &apos;s St George @-@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dr@@ agons won the premi@@ ership in 2010 by playing &quot; boring &quot; football .
W@@ ay@@ ne is talking about exciting foot@@ y .
he made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bel@@ lam@@ y said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and W@@ ay@@ ne said he didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ar@@ se .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
that &apos;s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like that .
to me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably weren &apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bel@@ lam@@ y also pointed out the Storm and Ro@@ os@@ ters game was a higher scoring contest than the Br@@ on@@ cos and Cow@@ boys game .
the Br@@ on@@ cos game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t watched it yet but what was the score ? 16 @-@ 12 ?
our game it was 20 @-@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foot@@ y ?
or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting ?
to me it &apos;s agendas .
if they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and Cow@@ boys or Cr@@ on@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks in next Saturday night &apos;s preliminary final at AA@@ MI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k bail on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kil@@ o@@ grams of cocaine that was smuggled into Qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and has been granted bail on a $ 200,000 su@@ rety .
Marko Mak@@ simovic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kil@@ o@@ grams of the drug from the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and doc@@ ked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ simovic was observed meeting with his co @-@ accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ ad@@ house cafe , where police found 40 kil@@ o@@ grams of the drug in a Toy@@ ota Echo .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , Mak@@ simovic &apos;s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Judge Peter F@@ lan@@ agan was concerned Mak@@ simovic was a flight risk .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
he travels to Serbia often , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
on the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ simovic &apos;s mother and step@@ father had jointly offered a su@@ rety of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
&quot; having read the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the imposition of a su@@ rety of $ 200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , &quot; Judge F@@ lan@@ agan said .
but that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ simovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports , report to police on a daily basis and ad@@ heres to a 6@@ pm @-@ 6@@ am cur@@ few .
Stevan H@@ og@@ g used girls phone to lure paed@@ oph@@ iles to send images
a paed@@ oph@@ ile used an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s phone to sol@@ icit child abuse images .
Stevan H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as she slept then log@@ ged into an online mes@@ saging service where he had a succession of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later w@@ oke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping H@@ og@@ g &apos;s hand .
she looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately aler@@ ting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web searches using terms for finding in@@ decent image of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would &quot; lead paed@@ oph@@ iles &quot; on the internet before &quot; pre@@ tending he was a police officer to scare them . &quot;
fiscal de@@ pu@@ te E@@ il@@ id@@ h Robertson told D@@ unde@@ e Sh@@ er@@ iff Court : &quot; he said it was an addiction - that he was add@@ icted to sc@@ aring people .
he accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paed@@ oph@@ iles .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to lure them in .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .
M@@ s Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying .
she saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
the girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and P@@ lay@@ St@@ ation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , of Ward Road , D@@ unde@@ e , pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making in@@ decent images of children on June 14 last year , breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence solic@@ itor Greg@@ or SIM asked that H@@ og@@ g not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; to his crime .
Sh@@ er@@ iff Al@@ is@@ ta@@ ir Car@@ mic@@ ha@@ el deferred sentence until October for social work background reports .
H@@ og@@ g was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases .
he was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date .
Zim@@ bab@@ we &apos;s Robert Mug@@ a@@ be delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ a@@ be , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium .
he was un@@ hurt , but video of the fall went vir@@ al on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mug@@ a@@ be during his address .
last month , they boo@@ ed and hec@@ kled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) chief wh@@ ip In@@ noc@@ ent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt N@@ r Mug@@ a@@ be &apos;s address .
&quot; the message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it &apos;s titled &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after Mr Mug@@ a@@ be &apos;s speech .
it warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief wh@@ ip said the party , led by Morgan Ts@@ v@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai , is &quot; worried &quot; about the threats to its politicians .
H@@ ewlett @-@ Pack@@ ard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ewlett @-@ Pack@@ ard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost @-@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year , separating its computer and prin@@ ter businesses from its faster @-@ growing corporate hard@@ ware and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ b@@ n , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ewlett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Wh@@ it@@ man , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
&quot; H@@ ewlett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &quot; said Wh@@ it@@ man .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ewlett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will have more than $ 50@@ b@@ n in annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ rival@@ ed integrated technology solutions &quot; to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stan@@ ford University graduates Bill H@@ ewlett and Dave Pack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to gar@@ age has been dubbed &quot; the birthplace of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
the move by HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
arsenal captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
W@@ eng@@ er has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
that best @-@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer &apos;s European Championship is clearly uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate an@@ kle injury and then looked back to his old shar@@ p@@ ness during pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not career @-@ threatening , &quot; said W@@ eng@@ er .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked with his ank@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
that might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as W@@ eng@@ er also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
there is also an uncomfortable pattern developing .
research by Prem@@ ier injuries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his debut six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of Ar@@ senal &apos;s 157 league games during the last five seas@@ ons .
the wider picture for Ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight seas@@ ons since 2007 @-@ 08 , they have been one of the two Prem@@ ier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
W@@ eng@@ er accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Ar@@ senal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
&quot; sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , &quot; said W@@ eng@@ er .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
with Ar@@ senal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chel@@ sea on Saturday and T@@ ot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , W@@ eng@@ er is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bel@@ l@@ er@@ í@@ n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning M@@ ath@@ ie@@ u De@@ bu@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
W@@ eng@@ er may also begin with Ki@@ er@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud in place of N@@ ach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , &quot; said W@@ eng@@ er .
although Ar@@ senal are clear favourites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ simir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe &apos;s most intimidating .
Dinamo are also un@@ beaten in 41 matches after producing their own &quot; inv@@ in@@ ci@@ ble &quot; campaign last season .
the stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter .
it was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
W@@ eng@@ er believes that Ar@@ senal have lear@@ nt the lesson of last season &apos;s Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ eng@@ er .
it has never been done at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not Dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar portr@@ ay@@ als in shows is gl@@ aring , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in males than females .
in a bid to address the problem , the Campaign Against Liv@@ ing mis@@ er@@ ably ( calm ) announced 2015 as the Year of the M@@ ale , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students displaying de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the su@@ ffe@@ rer had a high enough percentage of &quot; healthy mood &quot; friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
equally , for those not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising .
but of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
in this age of social @-@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often prioriti@@ sed over meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extr@@ in@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ in@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health .
and as a billionaire video @-@ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really doesn &apos;t buy greater happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their personalities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ros@@ s &apos;s p@@ ining for Rac@@ hel , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
as a Sam@@ ar@@ itan worker explained to me : .... &quot; my listening role to people feeling depressed and suic@@ idal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference . &quot;
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old ad@@ age of &quot; getting on with it &quot; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long @-@ term coping mechanisms .
it highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
as much as my objective , out@@ sider status over the phone helps people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central &apos;s Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central per@@ k .
or , better still , if in Star@@ buc@@ ks you see someone alone , give a smile and say hel@@ lo .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is broadcasting on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the full 2@@ 36 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria scores to help P@@ S@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after scoring against Mal@@ mo .
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help P@@ S@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Par@@ c des Prin@@ ces on Tuesday .
di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a P@@ S@@ G player to set the French champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 61st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ h@@ tar Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the kn@@ ock@@ out rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a vin@@ tage display by Lau@@ rent Bl@@ an@@ c &apos;s side with Zlatan Ibrahim@@ ovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substitu@@ ted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his ill@@ ustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League , so to win 2 @-@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , &quot; said Bl@@ an@@ c .
it aug@@ urs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
Ibrahim@@ ovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2 @-@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x in L@@ ig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentina w@@ inger was labelled as the man to take P@@ S@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti &apos;s pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past Johan Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected P@@ S@@ G to ro@@ mp to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick @-@ off and , with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in midfield , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
but , save for a Nikola Djurd@@ jic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Tr@@ ap@@ p &apos;s far post in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , P@@ S@@ G let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing , not least from Ibrahim@@ ovic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the restart .
nevertheless , he proved much more ad@@ ept when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an Ibrahim@@ ovic pass that Di Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was tipped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahim@@ ovic had fl@@ ic@@ ked on a left @-@ wing cross from Max@@ well .
that ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a super@@ b stop by Wil@@ and from point @-@ blank range to deny David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ ez@@ zi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach Age H@@ are@@ ide later admitted P@@ S@@ G were a class above his side , the Norwegian saying : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
the qualifiers are not enough .
hats off to Paris .
it was a magnificent match from them .
Gl@@ encore raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ encore , hit by collapsing commodities prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt @-@ sl@@ ashing plan .
London @-@ listed Gl@@ encore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is grappling with tum@@ bling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets .
the rights issue sent Gl@@ encore &apos;s share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
shares jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the F@@ T@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ encore had last week revealed the $ 2.5 @-@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $ 30 billion debt pile by about a third .

Mat@@ t Dam@@ on down@@ plays diversity in filmmaking
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on confronted African @-@ American filmmaker E@@ ffie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during Sunday night &apos;s episode of H@@ B@@ O &apos;s Project green@@ light , the seas@@ oned actor cut Brown off while she was emphas@@ izing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protag@@ onist in the project &apos;s chosen screenplay .
&quot; when we &apos;re talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on asserted .
shocked , Brown reacted with offended dis@@ belief , letting out &quot; H@@ oo ! W@@ ow . Ok@@ ay , &quot; as The Mar@@ tian actor &apos;s comments settled in the air .
Dam@@ on and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ lec@@ k and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show &apos;s finalists .
&quot; I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is , how they &apos;re going to treat the character of Har@@ mony , &quot; Brown initially said .
the only black character who &apos;s a h@@ oo@@ ker who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the De@@ ar White People producer pushed for finalists Le@@ o Angel@@ os and K@@ rist@@ en Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ ci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Dam@@ on retorted their directing could &quot; end up giving us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion aired , social media exploded in disapproval over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the clip writing , &quot; Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is so White it hurts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ twe@@ ets and 4,000 likes since being posted .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black L@@ ives Mat@@ ter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of col@@ or .
in February , singer Prince all@@ uded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Al@@ bu@@ m of the Year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; he said .
like books and black lives , albums still matter .
more recently , leaders of the Black L@@ ives Mat@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth H@@ ass@@ el@@ bec@@ k &apos;s question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; the Black L@@ ives Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , &quot; leaders said .
Dam@@ on was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers , producers and media mog@@ ul@@ s invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church &apos;s portr@@ ayal in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ns first champion
pro @-@ rock clim@@ ber and bus@@ boy Isa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
the competition show , which just wrapped up its 7th season , has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and camer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved climbing a 75 @-@ foot ro@@ pe in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first @-@ ever athlete to complete American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or &apos;s gr@@ u@@ eling stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about , like I &apos;ve never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , &quot; Isa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pay @-@ bu@@ mp .
so to all of a sudden ... like I can &apos;t even imagine what it &apos;s going to be like ... the future is unknown .
executive producer K@@ ent W@@ eed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why , despite Brit@@ ten being the first ever competitor to finish the course , won &apos;t be awarded any prize money .
by the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there &apos;s more than one finisher , the one with the fastest time gets it , &quot; said W@@ eed .
as much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great grati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he harb@@ ors any ill will about it .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he &apos;s done .
he &apos;s received tons of acc@@ ol@@ ades from fans .
he &apos;s such a great guy , and a family man .
he &apos;s a hero to his kids and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I was going to be beat by someone , I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isa@@ ac . &quot;
and I think Isa@@ ac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed .
America Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or was renewed for an eighth season , which will begin filming in Spring 2016 .
Det@@ ro@@ it Tigers ti@@ p@@ to@@ e past Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins
Min@@ ne@@ apol@@ is -- The second half the season hasn &apos;t been a lot of fun for the Det@@ ro@@ it Tigers .
once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central .
reducing to being a spo@@ il@@ er , the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday , beating the Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins 5 @-@ 4 at Targ@@ et Fi@@ eld .
the T@@ wins squ@@ an@@ dered a chance to climb to within one @-@ half game of the Hou@@ ston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild @-@ card spot .
for Det@@ ro@@ it , if only for one night , it was a return of the three @-@ letter F @-@ word that has been so elusive over much of the season &apos;s second half .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it happens , &quot; Tigers manager Bra@@ d A@@ us@@ mus said .
Tigers pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon made his early offensive support hold up , as Det@@ ro@@ it scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then t@@ acked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) pit@@ ched 6 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three runs .
it was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
&quot; I just want to finish strong this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard for the bul@@ l@@ pen to throw every game , and that &apos;s why I want to go deep into the game .
Tigers designated hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and drove in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit night since he had four hits against the Se@@ attle mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he sw@@ ung the b@@ at well , &quot; A@@ us@@ mus said .
he looked good in ( bat@@ ting practice ) , looked notic@@ e@@ ably better in BP , and he carried it right into the game .
trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh in@@ ning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bux@@ ton led off the in@@ ning with a double down the left field line .
right fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ ic@@ ks reached on a bun@@ t single , and Simon got second bas@@ eman Brian D@@ oz@@ ier to strike out sw@@ inging before being lifted for left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine hard@@ y .
hard@@ y walked M@@ auer , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ ok@@ ie designated hit@@ ter Miguel S@@ ano , who ripped a two @-@ run single to left off right @-@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w Verhagen .
with a pair of runners on and the tying run at second , Verhagen got third bas@@ eman T@@ rev@@ or Pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e to ground into a double play .
it was the major @-@ league @-@ leading 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e hit into a DP .
after Det@@ ro@@ it t@@ acked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth , M@@ auer ripped an R@@ BI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Ron@@ don to make it 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ h@@ ander struck out S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Det@@ ro@@ it took advantage of a ru@@ sty P@@ hi@@ l Hug@@ hes in the early going .
the Tigers posted three runs in the first two inn@@ ings against the veteran right @-@ h@@ ander , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflam@@ mation .
&quot; obviously not the start I &apos;d like to have , &quot; Hug@@ hes said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third in@@ ning . &quot;
after getting the lead@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes gave up a single to second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk to right fiel@@ der J@@ .@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought up Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who singled up the middle for the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z sn@@ apped his 0 @-@ for @-@ 21 stre@@ ak with runners in scoring position .
third bas@@ eman Nick Cast@@ ell@@ anos followed with a single to right , scoring another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
the Tigers added on in the second , getting a one @-@ out double from cat@@ cher James Mc@@ Can@@ n and a two @-@ out single by center fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to make it 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big hit , &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
he didn &apos;t hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hug@@ hes , who was on a pitch count , pit@@ ched a sc@@ ore@@ less third in@@ ning before being replaced by right @-@ handed reli@@ ever A.@@ J. Ach@@ ter .
Hug@@ hes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tigers R@@ HP An@@ ib@@ al San@@ che@@ z was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder .
he will be examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed surgery on San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder back in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid @-@ August , was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start .
with San@@ che@@ z out , L@@ HP Daniel Nor@@ ris will come off the D@@ L to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris is 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ HP David Pr@@ ice on July 30 .
he has been out since Aug@@ . 20 with a strained right obl@@ ique .
the Tigers and T@@ wins will wrap up their three @-@ game series at Targ@@ et Fi@@ eld on Wednesday .
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2 , 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will oppose Min@@ nes@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ER@@ A ) .
X@@ I urges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday .
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve opening @-@ up policies , &quot; he said , addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Le@@ ading Group for deepening Over@@ all Reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of border @-@ control policies , encouraging state @-@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off @-@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources , ensuring a law @-@ based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the law@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or &quot; green card , &quot; by opti@@ m@@ izing requirements and streamlining the application process .
guaranteeing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Prem@@ ier L@@ i Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang , and senior leaders Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Zhang Ga@@ oli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
mini @-@ bags are the height of fashion - Zaman New@@ sp@@ aper Saturday Sup@@ pl@@ ement
the subject eventually returned to bags in the world of fashion .
the recent outstanding trend is those mini@@ atures ...
it is possible to say that the small bags that are placed next to the big ones draw attention .
it is said that small is beautiful .
this point of view also applies to bags .
even though we didn &apos;t ti@@ re of walking the streets with almost @-@ su@@ it@@ case @-@ sized bags , the tide has started to turn and bags are inclined to be smaller .
small bags already existed but they appeared before us in minim@@ ised versions of big shoulder bags .
only your telephone , credit card and keys fit inside these tiny bags .
starting with C@@ é@@ line and Her@@ m@@ è@@ s , the trend spread with P@@ rad@@ a .
transforming this bag mania into an interest for mini @-@ bags has affected the newly emerging models .
Lo@@ e@@ we presented the fun bags it created in two siz@@ es .
among the bags , in the shape of pand@@ as , polar bears and el@@ eph@@ ants , the most outstanding ones are the el@@ eph@@ ant @-@ shaped ones .
presented by luxury brands with phenomenal names , mini versions of the big bags seem to attract red @-@ carpet celebrities most .
one of the most popular is the &quot; Bir@@ kin &quot; bag Her@@ m@@ è@@ s created as a dedication to Jan@@ e Bir@@ kin .
even though Jan@@ e Bir@@ kin said that she does not want her name to be remembered with a bag , she is now im@@ printed in the memory in this way .
fashion weeks led to the popul@@ ar@@ ization of the mini @-@ bag trend .
consequently , mini @-@ bags have been prominent on the podium .
since they are very small , it is not really possible to wear them on your arm .
they can be worn across the body with their long str@@ aps .
however , we saw these str@@ aps tang@@ led around the w@@ ris@@ ts of the models on the podium .
F@@ endi is one of those taking the mini @-@ bag theme one step forward .
it has some advice for those who cannot fit into mini @-@ bags but cannot abandon them either .
mini @-@ bags as a friend of big bags .
how ?
by transforming the mini @-@ bags into a bag ornam@@ ent that can be attached to bigger ones .
featured on the po@@ di@@ ums , this presentation has taken to the streets very quickly .
let &apos;s see what else we will see !
Den@@ im changes skin
Turkey is on a level that can compete with world brands in terms of den@@ im .
the experience gained in production has been enriched with design .
L@@ oft is one of them .
we now see that black designs , having been few in the past , take their place on the shelves every season .
Den@@ im found its closest friend in a season when black colours are on the rise .
leather pieces and designs with leather details come to the forefront as the rebel@@ li@@ ous friend of den@@ im .
generally , z@@ ip@@ pered short designs called &quot; motor@@ bike &quot; are most prominent .
the strong mood of leather complete with black pieces ; chi@@ ff@@ on long bl@@ ouses and bright swe@@ at@@ shirts , provides a cas@@ ual and ch@@ ic appearance .
in the past , young people wore den@@ im and wanted to be lost in the crowd .
it was thought that it would save the day .
nowadays , young people want to wear designs that are comfortable and emphasise their style at the same time .
within this perspective , it can be said that L@@ oft correctly understood its target group with their collections and accessories it designed
a small step for Ban@@ ks@@ y , a giant step for the &quot; Global &quot;
bringing together the works of mysterious street artist Ban@@ ks@@ y , the world premi@@ è@@ re of the collection &quot; The Art of Ban@@ ks@@ y &quot; was held in Istanbul .
a product of 15 years of work from the artist and gathering the origin@@ als of 85 works for the first time , the exhibition is the first in the Global Karak@@ ö@@ y building .
the first exhibition by the mysterious street artist Ban@@ ks@@ y in Istanbul opened yesterday in the Global Karak@@ ö@@ y ( R@@ ı@@ h@@ t@@ ı@@ m Street ) .
the world famous artist , who conce@@ als his identity and uses an alias , was not present at the exhibition opening of course .
we also don &apos;t know if he came to Istanbul or not .
however , Ban@@ ks@@ y is not aware of this exhibition according to Steve Lazar@@ idas , curator of the exhibition .
it is not necessary to receive permission from him .
the reason is that old friends Ban@@ ks@@ y and Lazar@@ idas par@@ ted company with each other after 12 years .
the exhibited works were partly collected from Lazar@@ idas and collectors .
however , there are issues that Ban@@ ks@@ y fans are cur@@ ious about .
what would Ban@@ ks@@ y think about the exhibition &quot; The Art of Ban@@ ks@@ y &quot; which brings together 85 of his works ?
for example , what would he think of entering the exhibition with a ticket ( 35 TL ) ? what would he say if he saw the 800 square metre gallery space with a small store created at the end ?
would he raise his voice against the fact that cloth bags , wallets and nec@@ kl@@ aces are printed with works of his such as Red ballo@@ on Girl , m@@ aid , smile Now , which draws attention to the wounds of the world ?
Ban@@ ks@@ y followers feel disappointed by the turning of an exhibition of an artist who conce@@ als his identity and has an an@@ arch@@ ist soul into such consumer goods .
this is certainly not the style of Ban@@ ks@@ y .
nevertheless , get your limited availability tickets before they are sold out !
small for Ban@@ ks@@ y but giant for the glob@@ alised world , the exhibition &quot; The Art of Ban@@ ks@@ y &quot; can be seen until April .
they are des@@ pic@@ able and cruel .
let them dig d@@ it@@ ches .
President Recep Tayyip Er@@ doğan continued his reaction against the academics that signed the declaration .
Er@@ doğan said , &quot; They are cruel , they are des@@ pic@@ able . &quot;
because those who stand by the op@@ press@@ ors are op@@ press@@ ors .
he said , &quot; S@@ ince they stand by those who slaughtered , they committed the same offence . &quot;
laying flowers at the scene of the explosion in Sul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met , Recep Tayyip Er@@ doğan said , &quot; I shared our grief both with the German President and German Chancellor because of the fact that 10 of our German friends were killed during this action in Sul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met Square that is full of history and civil@@ ization , and simply a square of peace - particularly in a place like this , near to the German F@@ oun@@ tain . &quot;
firstly I would like to convey my condolences to the German people , especially to the families of the victims .
he said , &quot; Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination . &quot;
continuing his reaction towards the academics who signed the declaration , Er@@ doğan stated the following : &quot; I condemn again and strongly condemn in particular the academics who put their signature under this slaughter by publishing a &quot; pitch @-@ black &quot; declaration even in the face of all these terrorist incidents . &quot;
I want our nation to understand much more closely who is who ; in other words , having a title of professor , assistant professor does not make a person literate .
they are completely dark people .
they are cruel , they are des@@ pic@@ able .
since they stand by those who slaughtered , they also committed the same offence .
what do these dark academics think about those babies , 3 @-@ year old Mev@@ l@@ ü@@ de who died a mar@@ ty@@ r with her father in the incident that occurred in Ç@@ ın@@ ar ?
how can they allow their conscience to stand by her killers ?
I am inviting all the judicial authorities , university sen@@ ates to do their duty for these acts against our constitution and laws .
yesterday , I said that all the necessary steps should be taken rapidly .
let them do whatever they do out there .
if they want to do politics , let them do politics in parliament .
if they cannot do it in parliament , let them go and dig d@@ it@@ ches or go to the mountains .
I am saying it clearly and explicitly .

&quot; while I was searching for two wrestler children , I found 26 people &quot;
the second documentary from Met@@ e G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han , &quot; Young Wrest@@ ler , &quot; 66th .
it became the first Turkish documentary to be selected in the &quot; Gen@@ eration K@@ plus &quot; section of the Berlin Film Festival ( February 11 @-@ 21 ) .
originally from Edirne but with a production company in the Netherlands , G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han talked about how and why he shot the documentary which he completed in the summer of 2014 .
telling the story of six students in a boarding school from Am@@ as@@ ya who aimed at becoming the world champion in the field of wrestling , the documentary &quot; Young wrestlers &quot; will compete in the &quot; Gen@@ eration K@@ plus &quot; section of the Berlin Film Festival .
being the first made @-@ in @-@ Turkey documentary to be selected in this section , Young wrestlers is one of the candidates for the Cr@@ ystal Bear award .
Met@@ e G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han is originally from Edirne even though he was born and raised in the Netherlands .
he listened to stories about gre@@ ase wrestling from his grandfather and watched competitions in Turkey , where he came during the summer when he was a child .
&quot; there are not only political problems in Turkey . &quot;
I wanted to tell the world what is going on in Anatolia other than that .
with the idea , &quot; wrestling , one of our ancest@@ or sports , is not well known , &quot; for example , he brought together 6 directors and wanted to create a documentary project .
this project remained inconclusive but news in a magazine he read on a plane opened the door to another project for G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han .
&quot; we stayed in a sugar factory &quot;
tracing the article that talked about two little wrestler brothers aged 10 @-@ 11 , Met@@ e G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han went so Sam@@ sun , where their family lives .
the father of the children did not give permission to shoot a documentary .
G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han talked about how he overcame this challenge as follows : &quot; I thought about what I could do all day long . &quot;
&quot; because the support of the Ministry of Culture might be withdrawn . &quot;
the father mentioned a boarding school in Am@@ as@@ ya , where the children would go .
I thought of going there .
while I was searching for two children , I found 26 children with an interest in wrestling .
we started shooting preparations and fin@@ alized the author@@ ization .
we did not even have a place to stay .
&quot; we stayed in the dormitory of a sugar factory . &quot;
language was the biggest challenge posed for the director by the documentary , the shooting of which was completed in 3 weeks .
stating that three different languages were spoken on the set of the film in which a foreign director of cinematography and a s@@ ound@@ man worked , G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han said , &quot; I did not know what I would come across during the shoot . &quot;
he says , &quot; They did not know Turkish either . &quot;
young wrestlers focuses on the story of six of the 26 child wrestlers .
Baran , who was brought up by his grandfather and had a weight problem , Har@@ un , who could not participate in training because he broke his arm , Bey@@ t@@ ullah , who is ambitious but has some health problems , Ü@@ mit , who is the pretty boy of the school , the youngest champion Ahmet and Muham@@ med , who holds the group together ...
Met@@ e G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han says of working with the children as follows : &quot; I let them be completely natural . &quot;
I tried to use only Muham@@ med everywhere .
I shot the training for the first one and a half weeks .
I wanted that the children act as if there were no camera .
&quot; fortunately they quickly adapted . &quot;
it was a surprise to be selected for Berlin
stating that he did not expect Young wrestlers to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival , Met@@ e G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han said , &quot; We were ready , but it was a surprise for us to be selected for Berlin . &quot;
young wrestlers is not a sports documentary , it is a production that narr@@ ates the struggle of the children and a sl@@ ice of their life .
he says , &quot; I wanted to highlight the struggle of children with family problems to find an identity and their story of coping with their problems . &quot;
support from the world of art for the academics
the storm that broke out after the declaration of &quot; The Initiative of academics for Peace , &quot; went so far that investigations were opened against the academics and they were taken into custody yesterday ; but at the same time , there are also statements of support arriving one after another .
the first support came from the liter@@ ati , among whom there are many famous people .
film makers expressed their support the day before yesterday , and theatre actors did so yesterday .

H@@ ür@@ rem Sultan &apos;s red hair , Bere@@ n &apos;s n@@ ose , Justin &apos;s hair ...
trying to look like celebrities is considered normal to some extent but it is regarded as a psychological disorder after the point that it starts to completely affect your life .
&quot; celebrity worship syndrome , &quot; also known as &quot; the syndrome of wor@@ shipping famous people &quot; is a matter that has already become an academic issue around the world and is a newly spoken about issue in our country .
it can be considered normal to some extent that ladies run to the hair sal@@ ons with photos of celebrities .
however , we should not forget the &quot; H@@ ür@@ rem Sultan &quot; year when all the youth walked around with red Irish hair .
it was already reported that &quot; Bere@@ n &apos;s n@@ ose &quot; led the way in plastic surgeries in 2015 .
the situation is not so very different on the part of men .
once upon a time , d@@ ressing like Pol@@ at Al@@ em@@ dar was a custom .
now a totally different trend prevails everywhere .
our surroundings are full of young boys that are copies of Justin Bi@@ e@@ ber .
it is at such an extent that the following quot@@ e of useless information was read thousands of times : &quot; firstly , when you go to the hairdres@@ ser , have your hair cut at the sides , in other words , the part over and around your ears up to the upper part of your head . &quot;
however , the sides should be short .
after the cutting process is over , you should shape your hair lightly with water .
after the shaping process , fix your hair with the help of spray .
&quot; it is necessary to shape it when it is w@@ et to get Justin hair . &quot;
all of these issues have already become academic subjects around the world , but they remind us of the newly spoken &quot; celebrity worship syndrome , &quot; in other words &quot; the syndrome of wor@@ shipping famous people . &quot;
fans of celebrities are considered as a &quot; bund@@ le of love . &quot;
artists always pride themselves on their fan numbers and how their fans affect them .
luckily , psychology does not consider the condition so simply .
in particular , it is much discussed that adoles@@ cents make decisions about what they eat and drink , what they listen to , what they wear in accordance with celebrities .
excessive loyalty to people presented as un@@ attainable , and taking them as role models is defined as a mental disorder .
senior psychologist S@@ ü@@ me@@ y@@ ye Demir accepts that Turkey falls behind in terms of studies into this field .
however she does not fail to notice the fact that families are gradually becoming conscious : &quot; one of the basic issues in the science of psychology is people being at peace with themselves and finding peace in their identities . &quot;
in the past , it was not taken seriously if children filled their rooms with posters and played the role of someone .
this situation is now changing .
their parents feel the need to intervene in the situation .
&quot; passion@@ ate loyalty to someone is a sign of the fact that something has gone wrong in the teen &apos;s life . &quot;
fans jumping onto the emotional speed train
interest in celebrity is safe in moderation .
Demir advises to be careful of symptoms such as not wanting them to marry , en@@ vying their spouses and preferring their clothing styles .
as the name implies , we are talking about famous people .
being cur@@ ious about them and having an interest in their life is considered normal to some extent .
however , young people over@@ stepping the limits are prevalent according to the senior psychologist : &quot; when there is no one in the family or the surroundings to serve as a model for virtues and good behaviour , this gap is certainly filled . &quot;
good examples do not always emerge .
&quot; children also copy the negative things . &quot;
when we consult her about how we should approach them , S@@ ü@@ me@@ y@@ ye Demir starts by reminding us that the syndrome of celebrity worship is seen mostly in adoles@@ c@@ ence .
the problem is more easily overcome once it is taken into consideration that adoles@@ cents may be insecure .
on one hand , we are complaining about the limitations of family and on the other hand we are facing young people expecting support and affec@@ tion from them : &quot; we are obliged to take into consideration their emotional ups and downs . &quot;
new research put forward that they are forced by the changes occurring in their br@@ ains .
&quot; it should be taken naturally if an adoles@@ cent , jumping onto the emotional speed train , is attached to someone ; and they should be approached del@@ ic@@ ately . &quot;
it is possible to change behaviour
senior psychologist S@@ ü@@ me@@ y@@ ye Demir , reminds us of the duties falling into the share of parents to overcome celebrity worship syndrome :
identify their emotional problem and be sure that you are calm before bringing up the issue .
never let them suppress their emotions .
express your respect for their ad@@ oration in order to encourage freedom .
instead of teaching them by repri@@ man@@ ding , serve as a good model for them , discuss the people that can be a role model to them .
try to talk together about the roles of celebrities in our daily life .
it would be helpful to read books about the real world of celebrities together .
change your communication approach to the form of adult to adult .
do not forget the fact that addiction and motivation use the brain in the same way .
tell your child that errors are opportunities for change , and accept them as they are .
get the support of specialists dealing with being a fan .
those who get angry and those who admire both worship
at the base of the syndrome of celebrity worship there is a need to appeal and get help from someone .
it is in fact a un@@ prevent@@ able love , a call for help .
but unfortunately it is not perceived like this .
furthermore , this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to narrow it down to a country or a continent .
Dr. Rec@@ ai Yah@@ y@@ a@@ o@@ ğlu draws attention to the fact that there are certain people that occupy the television in every country .
the syndrome manif@@ ests itself mostly in an att@@ achment to the celebrities : &quot; they are extraordinary . &quot;
most people do not have their opportunities .
those who have do not live their life by acting like them .
it is because they do not embrace this life or they do not dare to do it .
&quot; however , both those who do not have the opportunities , and those who have the opportunities but do not live like them continue to watch them angrily . &quot;
there is no difference between those who cov@@ et them and those who watch them bur@@ sting with anger .
both admire them in@@ war@@ dly .
they earn money without trouble , they are in magazines daily .
even knowing this is enough to increase their admir@@ ation .
other advice from the senior psychologist S@@ ü@@ me@@ y@@ ye Demir is to question the reality of these lives .
we should not fail to notice that artificial lives are being talked about .
support from the surrounding people steps in for the person who feels passion@@ ately about celebrity .
however , people insist on rejecting the fact that the celebrities they admire also have problems like them .

should I undergo a ch@@ ol@@ ec@@ yst@@ ostom@@ y ? - Family @-@ Health News - Zaman New@@ sp@@ aper
Dr. F@@ ev@@ zi Ö@@ z@@ g@@ ön@@ ül answers the questions in his column in the M@@ ey@@ dan New@@ sp@@ aper ..
I have gall@@ stones , I have stom@@ ach ache when I get up every morning and after meals ; and I visit the toil@@ et 2 times or more everyday .
could it prevent me from losing weight ?
I have now started to use al@@ kal@@ ine , but my appetite for meals hasn &apos;t diminished , I cannot lose any weight .
it has been the same since my childhood .
what should I do ?
in your opinion , should I undergo a ch@@ ol@@ ec@@ yst@@ ostom@@ y ?
answer : most of the time , an infection ac@@ companies gall@@ stones .
this complaint of stom@@ ach aches , occurring soon after meals , is a sign of the fact that your gall@@ bl@@ ad@@ der tigh@@ tens when you eat and you spill the infected g@@ all into the inte@@ st@@ ines .
disturbed by the infected g@@ all , the inte@@ st@@ ines try to quickly expel this g@@ all .
this is why you visit the toil@@ et frequently .
since you visit the toil@@ et frequently and what you eat is expelled without being dig@@ est@@ ed , losing weight becomes slower .
in my opinion , you should have this condition treated .
if you go to a gastro@@ enter@@ ologist and the condition is detected as I said , you can be free from this condition by using anti@@ bio@@ tics .
however , you may eventually have to undergo a ch@@ ol@@ ec@@ yst@@ ostom@@ y .
Alkal@@ ine pro@@ bio@@ tics may decrease your symp@@ tons but it does not cure them .
I advise you to use al@@ kal@@ ine pro@@ bio@@ tics anyway .
because this pro@@ bi@@ otic powder is the biggest help in losing weight .
I eat too much under stress
dear si@@ r , I eat continuously when I am stressed and angry ; and I gain weight .
how can I cope with this ?
answer : an excessive appetite for food means in fact that your energy needs are not met .
the reason for this may be eating less or skip@@ ping morning meals and lun@@ ches .
another reason is your failure to dig@@ est the food you eat .
to do this , your dig@@ esti@@ ve system should work health@@ ily .
if you do not have a problem such as an ul@@ c@@ er , re@@ flu@@ x or similar problems , the easiest way is to use a good pro@@ bi@@ otic medicine .
you will greatly feel its benefits .
I cannot gain weight , doctors do not know the reason
generally there is information about losing weight in your column .
all of it seems logical to me too , but my situation is a little bit different .
somehow I cannot gain weight .
the most important thing is I do not know why .
doctors do not say anything either .
answer : the techniques we apply are not intended for losing weight , but also regaining the physi@@ ological functions of the body and turning it into its ideal size .
being over@@ weight and being too thin are the same kinds of disorder .
failure to lose weight when fat and failure to gain weight when slim are cured with the same technique .
you lose weight more when you eat sweets and pa@@ stri@@ es .
I imagine you might have understood this by now .
it is also possible for you to be stimulated with Car@@ box@@ y therapy and gain weight through a healthy diet .
in other words , you became distant from your ideal body by losing weight .
other patients of ours became distant from their ideal bodies by putting on weight .
you will reach your ideal body by gaining weight , and they will do so by losing weight .
if the problem with the system is eliminated , you will gain weight , they will lose weight .
nevertheless , firstly the system should work properly .

children who feel wor@@ thless become stuck in &quot; hatred &quot;
there are some inn@@ ate emotions in people &apos;s world of emotion .
fear , sadness , happiness , aston@@ ishment , anger , anxiety ...
however , some emotions like hatred , holding a gr@@ udge and revenge emerge in children gradually and as a result of the wrong behaviour .
everybody needs to be an individual including during their childhood .
in other words , they desire that their parents and social circle respect their decisions , their opinion is asked in matters related to them , and they are made to feel valued .
enabling them to create the base on which to construct a healthy personality .
for example , behaviour such as making decisions in matters relating to the child ( what they wear , what they eat ) instead of the child , insisting on your truth without considering the wishes of the child ( sending a child to a music course even though they want to go to a football course ) means not respecting the personality of the child .
when their individ@@ uality and being are not respected , children lose the freedom of &quot; being themselves &quot; and their defence mechanism reveals emotions of anger and hatred in order to protect themselves .
stating that , &quot; The reason is that anger and hatred are in fact just oppos@@ ites of acceptance , &quot; psychologist Hil@@ al Arslan says that children do not accept what is done to them by showing hate and they try to say to both themselves and the people around them that they are precious .
saying that it is good for their personality development that children do not accept the situation and react to it , the senior psychologist said , &quot; The hatred here means I am also here , it serves the children &apos;s aim to protect their self @-@ respect . &quot;
she says , &quot; If children are allowed to be individuals , the hatred will be eliminated . &quot;
children try to protect their self by resor@@ ting to anger and hatred
saying that if children are exposed to the verbal and emotional violence of their parents and surroundings , it will cause negative emotions in children in a time that they are at a young age and are both physically and spirit@@ ually most vulnerable , Arslan states that negligence will make the child feel that their existence is not noticed and they are invisible .
Arslan continues with the following : &quot; maybe sometimes we can fail to meet the emotional needs ( not stro@@ king their hair , not hug@@ ging and kis@@ sing them , not caring about their school or other needs ) , and sometimes we can fail to meet also their physical needs ( eating , drinking , shelter , school needs etc . ) . &quot;
this is a growing attitude that opens the doors to anger and hatred .
for emotional and verbal violence , there is behaviour like humiliation , insulting , bel@@ it@@ tling , sc@@ olding , unnecessary and heavy punishment , making them feel wor@@ thless and y@@ elling .
since this behaviour is towards the personality of the child , it has a deep effect .
&quot; children who accept it , lose their self @-@ respect and spend their lives struggling with the feeling that they are wor@@ thless , un@@ worthy of being loved and inadequate , or they will protect themselves by resor@@ ting to anger and hatred . &quot;
